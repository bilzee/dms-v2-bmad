  - Seamless conversion from planned to actual delivery documentation
  - Partial delivery tracking capabilities
- **Pain Points:** 
  - Data re-entry between planning and execution phases
  - Inability to document deliveries offline
  - Complex form validation during field operations
- **Role Flexibility:** Potential overlap with Assessor roles depending on operational structure

### 4. Donors (Future Phase Implementation)
- **Role:** Organizations and individuals providing aid items and resources
- **Responsibilities:** Donation planning, commitment registration, delivery performance tracking
- **Operating Context:** Remote engagement with accountability and performance visibility requirements

- **Operating Context:** Backend system management with security and compliance oversight

## Market Context
Borno State humanitarian operations currently rely on paper-based processes with significant coordination gaps. No existing digital solution addresses the offline-first requirement combined with role flexibility and automatic approval capabilities essential for field conditions.

## User Validation Status
Field interviews with current Assessors, Coordinators, and Responders identified as immediate validation requirement for user research completion.
