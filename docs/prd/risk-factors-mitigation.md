# Risk Factors & Mitigation

## Technical Risks
- **Offline Complexity:** Risk of data corruption during extended offline periods
- **Sync Conflicts:** Multiple users editing same entities during offline operations
- **Device Limitations:** Performance issues on lower-end field devices

## Operational Risks
- **User Adoption:** Resistance to digital transformation from paper-based processes
- **Coordinator Bottlenecks:** System creating new bottlenecks instead of eliminating them
- **Data Quality:** Poor data entry practices undermining system effectiveness

## Mitigation Strategies
- **Comprehensive Testing:** Extensive offline scenario testing and data integrity validation
- **User Training:** Structured training program with ongoing support
- **Flexible Workflows:** Automatic approval options and role flexibility to prevent bottlenecks
