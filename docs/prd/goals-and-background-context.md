# Goals and Background Context

**Project Brief Status:** ✅ Yes - "Disaster Management PWA Project Brief.md" has been reviewed and incorporated

## Primary Goal
Create a Progressive Web App for disaster management in Borno State, Nigeria, implementing a structured Assessment → Coordination → Response workflow with offline-first capability to operate reliably in challenging field conditions with limited connectivity.

## Background Context
Current disaster response in Borno State lacks a coordinated digital system, resulting in:
- Assessment data loss during handoffs
- Coordination delays due to verification bottlenecks
- Inability to track response activities end-to-end
- No reliable offline-capable system for field operations
- Limited transparency and accountability in donor-response tracking

## Success Vision
- **Zero Data Loss:** Robust workflow from form submission to backend with complete data integrity during Assessment → Coordination → Response handoffs
- **Reduced Coordination Delays:** Streamlined verification processes with automatic approval options to prevent coordinator bottlenecks
- **Comprehensive Tracking:** Reliable incident monitoring from Active through Resolved status with role-based flexibility
- **Operational Transparency:** Management dashboards providing real-time visibility into disaster situations, response activities, and donor commitments/deliveries

## Business Rationale
This PWA addresses critical humanitarian coordination challenges in a region with extreme connectivity limitations. The offline-first architecture ensures continuous operation during disasters when infrastructure is compromised, while the structured workflow with flexible approval mechanisms maintains accountability through clear verification status indicators.
