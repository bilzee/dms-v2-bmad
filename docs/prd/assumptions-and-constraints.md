# Assumptions and Constraints

## Technical Assumptions
- **Device Capabilities:** Field workers have access to mid-range Android devices with GPS capability
- **Connectivity Patterns:** Intermittent connectivity with brief windows for synchronization
- **Network Infrastructure:** Limited but occasional access to 2G/3G networks in field locations

## Operational Constraints
- **Training Timeline:** Limited time for user training and system adoption
- **Change Management:** Transition from paper-based to digital processes requires cultural adaptation
- **Security Requirements:** Sensitive humanitarian data requires robust security measures

## Resource Limitations
- **Development Timeline:** MVP delivery required within specified project timeline
- **Infrastructure Budget:** Backend infrastructure must operate within budget constraints
- **Maintenance Capacity:** Long-term system maintenance must be sustainable with available resources
