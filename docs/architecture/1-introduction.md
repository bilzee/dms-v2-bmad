# 1\. Introduction

This document defines the comprehensive fullstack architecture for the Disaster Management Progressive Web App (DM-PWA) serving humanitarian operations in Borno State, Nigeria. The architecture prioritizes **offline-first operation**, **data integrity**, and **field reliability** over aesthetic sophistication, ensuring zero data loss in challenging connectivity environments.

## System Overview

The DM-PWA is a humanitarian coordination platform enabling rapid assessment and response during disaster scenarios. The system supports four primary user roles (Assessors, Responders, Coordinators, Donors) through a unified PWA interface with sophisticated offline capabilities and intelligent synchronization.

## Architectural Philosophy

**User Experience Drives Architecture** - Every technical decision stems from field worker needs:

* **Offline-First, Not Offline-Sometimes**: 100% core functionality without connectivity
* **Progressive Complexity**: Simple to start, scales with organizational maturity
* **Boring Technology Where Possible**: Proven, stable choices for critical paths
* **Exciting Where Necessary**: Modern PWA capabilities for offline excellence
* **Zero Data Loss Tolerance**: Multiple redundancy layers for data preservation

## Key Design Decisions

1. **Next.js 14 with App Router**: Server components for initial load performance, client components for offline capability
2. **IndexedDB + Dexie.js**: Robust offline storage with encryption and sync queue management
3. **PostgreSQL + Prisma**: Type-safe database access with migration management
4. **Zustand**: Lightweight state management optimized for offline scenarios
5. **Service Worker Architecture**: Background sync, cache management, and offline resilience

## Architecture Constraints

* **Device Reality**: Mid-range Android devices with limited CPU/RAM
* **Network Reality**: 2G/3G networks with frequent disconnections
* **User Reality**: High-stress scenarios requiring foolproof interfaces
* **Data Criticality**: Human lives depend on data integrity
