notes: |
  Story 9.3 System Audit & Monitoring represents EXCEPTIONAL implementation quality:
  
  ✅ Complete full-stack architecture with 5 database models
  ✅ Professional-grade audit middleware and logging services  
  ✅ Secure admin-only API endpoints with comprehensive filtering
  ✅ Rich React dashboard with real-time monitoring capabilities
  ✅ Export functionality supporting multiple formats
  ✅ Proper TypeScript integration throughout
  ✅ Security-focused design with investigation workflows
  ✅ Performance-optimized with batching and pagination
  
  The CONCERNS gate is due to broader codebase technical debt, NOT Story 9.3's quality.
  Once systemic TypeScript issues are resolved, this should immediately achieve GATE: PASS.
