# GATE DECISION
decision: "FAIL"
severity: "CRITICAL"
confidence: "HIGH"

# EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
summary: |
  Phase 1 Foundation validation reveals CRITICAL infrastructure failures that block 
  progression to Phase 2. Database deployment is non-functional, authentication system 
  has failing tests, and API endpoints cannot connect to backend services. Immediate 
  Dev Agent intervention required to address foundational issues.

# QA NOTES
notes: |
  This validation followed the test strategy P0 critical path methodology. The extensive 
  infrastructure failures indicate Phase 1 Foundation work was incomplete. Sequential 
  thinking methodology helped identify the cascade of dependencies - database failure 
  led to authentication failures which led to API integration failures.
  
  Recommend Dev Agent focus on infrastructure-first approach: database → auth → API 
  integration sequence for remediation.
