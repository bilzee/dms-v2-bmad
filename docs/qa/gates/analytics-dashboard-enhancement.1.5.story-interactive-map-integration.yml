# Risk Assessment
risks:
  high:
    - title: "Production Deployment Blocked"
      description: "Map functionality unavailable without Mapbox token configuration"
      mitigation: "Configure NEXT_PUBLIC_MAPBOX_ACCESS_TOKEN in environment"
  
  medium:
    - title: "Mapbox API Dependency"
      description: "External service dependency for core map functionality"
      mitigation: "Monitor Mapbox service availability and API limits"
  
  low:
    - title: "Free Tier Limitations"
      description: "Mapbox free tier limited to 50,000 map loads per month"
      mitigation: "Monitor usage and upgrade plan if needed"

# Requirements for PASS
pass_requirements:
  - "✅ Configure Mapbox access token in environment variables"
  - "✅ Verify full map rendering functionality with valid token"
  - "✅ Test complete user workflow: incident selection → map display → entity interaction"
  - "✅ Validate performance under realistic data loads"

# Recommendations
