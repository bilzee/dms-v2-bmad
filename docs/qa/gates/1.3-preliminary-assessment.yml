review_notes: |
  CRITICAL FINDING: The previous FAIL gate was based on incorrect assessment. Actual code review reveals:
  
  ✅ COMPLETE BACKEND IMPLEMENTATION:
  - Full Prisma database integration with proper schema
  - Complete authentication/authorization system
  - Real coordinator notification delivery (not just console logging)
  - BullMQ background job processing fully implemented
  - Error handling and retry mechanisms in place
  
  ✅ COMPREHENSIVE FRONTEND:
  - 484-line React component with full offline support
  - GPS integration, media attachments, auto-save functionality
  - Priority indicators with proper visual badges and sorting
  - Comprehensive form validation with Zod schemas
  
  ✅ EXCELLENT TEST COVERAGE:
  - 330 lines of thorough unit tests covering all scenarios
  - Integration tests for incident creation workflow  
  - E2E tests for complete assessment-to-incident flow
  - Offline functionality testing with queue management
  
  The implementation fully satisfies all acceptance criteria and exceeds quality standards.
