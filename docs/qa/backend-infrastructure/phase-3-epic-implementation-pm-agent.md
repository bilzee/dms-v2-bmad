- [ ] Service worker caches critical offline functionality
- [ ] App manifest includes proper icons and metadata
- [ ] Installation prompts appear on supported browsers

### TI-002: Performance Optimization (Priority: HIGH - Day 12)  
**Story**: <3 second load times and battery optimization for field operations

**PM Coordination Tasks:**
- **Dev Agent Assignment**: Performance optimization and benchmarking
- **QA Agent Assignment**: Load time validation and mobile device testing
- **Timeline**: 1 day optimization + 0.5 day validation
- **Dependencies**: Real backend performance baseline from Phase 2

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Initial page load <3 seconds on 3G connection
- [ ] Offline form access <1 second
- [ ] Optimized for mid-range Android devices (4GB RAM)
- [ ] Battery usage minimized for 8-hour field operations

### TI-003: Security Implementation (Priority: HIGH - Day 13)
**Story**: Robust security for sensitive humanitarian data

**PM Coordination Tasks:**
- **Dev Agent Assignment**: Security hardening implementation
- **QA Agent Assignment**: Security audit and vulnerability testing
- **Timeline**: 1 day implementation + 0.5 day audit
- **Dependencies**: Epic 9 authentication system from Phase 2

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] AES-256 encryption for IndexedDB offline storage
- [ ] JWT authentication security hardened (secure cookies, proper expiry)
- [ ] Data transmission encryption verified (HTTPS + additional layers)
- [ ] Security audit passes with no high-risk vulnerabilities

### TI-004: Data Backup & Recovery (Priority: MEDIUM - Day 14)
**Story**: Reliable backup and disaster recovery for humanitarian data

**PM Coordination Tasks:**
- **Architect Agent**: Review backup strategy and disaster recovery procedures
- **Dev Agent Assignment**: Implement automated backup verification
- **Timeline**: 0.5 day implementation + 0.5 day testing
- **Dependencies**: Supabase backup configuration

**Success Metrics:**
- [ ] Automated daily backups configured in Supabase
- [ ] Point-in-time recovery tested successfully
- [ ] Data integrity verification procedures established
- [ ] Disaster recovery runbook documented

## PHASE 3 COORDINATION SCHEDULE

- Production deployment preparation
- Documentation finalization

**Afternoon (QA Agent):**
- Disaster recovery testing
- Production deployment validation
- Final quality gate assessment

## CRITICAL RISK MANAGEMENT

### High-Risk Dependencies
1. **PWA Service Worker**: May conflict with existing offline functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Incremental enhancement rather than replacement
   - **Contingency**: Rollback to current offline implementation if issues

2. **Performance Optimization**: Database changes may affect functionality
   - **Mitigation**: Measure before/after performance impact
   - **Contingency**: Selective optimization rollback if regressions detected

3. **Security Changes**: May impact existing authentication flows
   - **Mitigation**: Test all user workflows after security implementation
   - **Contingency**: Security enhancement postponement if critical workflows break

### Timeline Risk Mitigation
- **Buffer Time**: Each story includes 0.5 day buffer for issue resolution
- **Parallel Work**: QA validation runs concurrently with next story development
- **Escalation Path**: Architect Agent available for complex technical decisions
