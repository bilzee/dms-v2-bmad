## TI-003: SECURITY IMPLEMENTATION VALIDATION (Day 13)

### Security Audit Testing
**Vulnerability Assessment:**

1. **Authentication Security:**
```bash
# Test authentication bypass attempts
# Verify JWT token security
# Test session management security
# Validate role-based access control
```

2. **Data Protection Testing:**
```bash
# Test offline data encryption
# Verify transmission security (HTTPS)
# Test API input validation
# Audit logging verification
```
