Product Owner Agent Instructions: Story 4.3 MVP Scope Reduction

  Context and Current Situation

  Story Status: Story 4.3 Conflict Resolution is functionally complete for users but has complex advanced
  features causing persistent test failures and development inefficiencies.

  Test Results Summary:
  - ConflictResolver: 4/15 tests pass (27%) - Advanced filtering and UI features failing
  - SyncEngine: 11/19 tests pass (58%) - Complex detection algorithms failing
  - Core Functionality: LOCAL_WINS/SERVER_WINS resolution strategies working perfectly

  Development Cost: 3+ cycles of dev agent fixes with 15+ hours invested, yet advanced features remain
  problematic.

  - Scope: Basic timestamp and field-level conflict detection only
  - Remove: Severity classification, concurrent edit detection

  Original AC2: ✅ KEEP - Coordinator override capability for conflict resolution
  - Scope: LOCAL_WINS and SERVER_WINS strategies only
  - Remove: MERGE and MANUAL strategies, mandatory justification

  Original AC3: ✅ KEEP - Side-by-side comparison of conflicting data
  - Scope: Simple data comparison display
  - Remove: Advanced filtering and search capabilities

  Original AC4: ✅ KEEP - Audit trail for conflict resolution decisions
  - Scope: Basic resolution logging (who, what, when)
  - Remove: Complex audit trail visualization and detailed metadata

  FEATURES TO REMOVE FROM MVP

  **Remove from Current Implementation:**
  1. Conflict severity classification (CRITICAL/HIGH/MEDIUM/LOW)
  2. Conflict filtering by severity, entity type, conflict type
  3. Mandatory justification text area and validation
  4. Concurrent edit detection algorithms
  5. MERGE and MANUAL resolution strategies
  6. Advanced statistics dashboard with multiple metrics
  7. Complex conflict queue pagination and search

  SIMPLIFIED USER STORY

  **As a** Coordinator
  **I want to** resolve conflicts when multiple users edit the same entities
  **so that** data integrity is maintained during concurrent operations

  **Simplified Acceptance Criteria:**
  1. Detect timestamp conflicts for same-entity updates
  2. Coordinator can select LOCAL_WINS or SERVER_WINS resolution
  3. Show side-by-side comparison of conflicting versions
  4. Log basic audit trail of resolution decisions

  **Simplified Tasks:**
  - [x] Basic conflict detection (timestamp and field-level)
  - [x] Simple ConflictResolver interface with resolution buttons
  - [x] Side-by-side data comparison view
  - [x] LOCAL_WINS/SERVER_WINS resolution API endpoints
  - [x] Basic audit logging for resolved conflicts

  Impact Assessment for PO Decision

  ✅ BENEFITS OF SCOPE REDUCTION

  1. Immediate User Value
  - Conflict resolution functionality available immediately
  - No development blockers preventing coordinator use
  - Core data integrity protection achieved

  2. Resource Efficiency
  - Time Savings: 8-12 development hours redirected to other priorities
  - Quality Improvement: Focus on making core features robust
  - Reduced Risk: Eliminate test infrastructure complexity

  3. Technical Debt Reduction
  - Simpler codebase easier to maintain
  - Reduced testing complexity and faster CI/CD
  - Lower risk of integration issues with future features

  ⚠️ TRADE-OFFS TO CONSIDER

  1. Future Feature Debt
  - Advanced features move to future iterations
  - May require refactoring when re-added
  - User workflow might need enhancement later

  2. Coordinator Experience
  - Less sophisticated conflict management initially
  - Manual prioritization instead of automatic severity
  - Simplified but potentially less efficient workflow

  PO Decision Framework

  Key Questions for Product Decision:

  1. User Priority: Do coordinators need advanced conflict management in MVP, or is basic resolution
  sufficient?
  2. Market Timing: Is it better to deliver working conflict resolution now vs delaying for advanced
  features?
  3. Resource Allocation: Should 8-12 hours be spent on test fixes vs new user-facing features?
  4. Risk Assessment: What's the impact of shipping simplified conflict resolution vs delayed advanced
  version?

  Recommended PO Actions

  IMMEDIATE (Next 30 minutes)

  1. Stakeholder Validation:
    - Confirm with key coordinator users if simplified conflict resolution meets immediate needs
    - Validate that LOCAL_WINS/SERVER_WINS covers 80%+ of real conflict scenarios
  2. Product Decision:
    - Approve simplified MVP scope for Story 4.3
    - Move advanced features to Story 4.4 or later iteration
  3. Team Communication:
    - Notify SM Agent of scope change for sprint planning
    - Brief Architect Agent on simplified requirements validation

  SCOPE CHANGE DOCUMENTATION

  File to Update: docs/stories/4.3.conflict-resolution.md

  Required Changes:
  - Update acceptance criteria to simplified version
  - Mark advanced features as "Future Enhancement"
  - Update implementation status to "MVP COMPLETE"
  - Document removed features in "Post-MVP Roadmap" section

  BACKLOG IMPACT

  New Story Creation:
  **Story 4.4: Advanced Conflict Resolution**
  - Conflict severity classification
  - Advanced filtering and search
  - MERGE/MANUAL resolution strategies
  - Enhanced justification workflows
  - Advanced coordinator analytics

  **Priority:** Post-MVP Enhancement
  **Estimated Effort:** 12-15 hours

  Final PO Recommendation

  ✅ APPROVE MVP SCOPE REDUCTION

  Rationale:
  - Core business value (data integrity) achieved
  - User functionality fully accessible
  - Resource efficiency maximized
  - Risk minimized with working solution

  Next Steps:
  1. Document simplified requirements
  2. Approve current implementation as MVP complete
  3. Create Story 4.4 for advanced features
  4. Redirect development resources to higher-priority user stories

  This approach delivers immediate value while preserving advanced features for future iteration when
  development bandwidth allows proper implementation and testing.
