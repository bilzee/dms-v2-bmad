# Analytics Dashboard Left Panel Connectivity Fix

## Issue Summary
The analytics dashboard left panel was not properly connected to incident-specific preliminary assessments and population data from the database due to missing foreign key relationships in the schema.

## Root Cause
- **Missing foreign keys**: No relationship between `Incident` and `PreliminaryAssessment`, `AffectedEntity`
- **Incomplete data flow**: API methods returned all data instead of incident-filtered data
- **Schema gaps**: No way to query assessments by specific incident ID

## Changes Made

### 1. Schema Updates (`packages/frontend/prisma/schema.prisma`)

#### Added to `Incident` model:
```prisma
// Relationships
preliminaryAssessments PreliminaryAssessment[]
affectedEntities       AffectedEntity[]
```

#### Added to `PreliminaryAssessment` model:
```prisma
incidentId  String?   // Nullable - preliminary assessments can predate incidents
// Relationships  
incident    Incident? @relation(fields: [incidentId], references: [id])
```

#### Added to `AffectedEntity` model:
```prisma
incidentId  String?   // Foreign key to incident
// Relationships
incident    Incident? @relation(fields: [incidentId], references: [id])
```

### 2. DatabaseService Updates (`packages/frontend/src/lib/services/DatabaseService.ts`)

#### Updated `getPopulationDataByIncident()`:
- **Before**: Returned all entities (ignoring incidentId)
- **After**: Filters by `incidentId` using proper WHERE clause

#### Updated `getAffectedEntitiesByIncident()`:
- **Before**: Returned all entities with TODO comment
- **After**: Filters by `incidentId` using proper WHERE clause

#### Added new method `getPreliminaryAssessmentsByIncident()`:
```typescript
static async getPreliminaryAssessmentsByIncident(incidentId: string) {
  const preliminaryAssessments = await this._prisma.preliminaryAssessment.findMany({
    where: { incidentId: incidentId },
    orderBy: { reportingDate: 'desc' }
  });
  return preliminaryAssessments;
}
```

### 3. Analytics API Enhancement (`packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/monitoring/analytics/incidents/[id]/summary/route.ts`)

#### Enhanced data aggregation:
- Now fetches preliminary assessments for the specific incident
- Combines rapid assessment data with preliminary assessment data
- Uses `Math.max()` to avoid double-counting between assessment types
- Provides comprehensive population impact calculation

## Database Migration Required

**CRITICAL**: These schema changes require a database migration:

```bash
# Generate migration
npx prisma db push

# Or create a proper migration
npx prisma migrate dev --name "add-incident-relationships"
```

## Data Population Required

After migration, you'll need to populate the new foreign key relationships:

1. **Link existing preliminary assessments to incidents** (if any exist)
2. **Link affected entities to incidents** (required for proper filtering)
3. **Verify data integrity** with test queries

## Testing Instructions

### 1. Verify Schema Migration
```bash
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### 2. Test Database Connectivity
```bash
# Start development server
pnpm dev

# Check browser console for any Prisma errors
# Navigate to analytics dashboard and select an incident
```

### 3. Verify Data Flow
1. Navigate to `/coordinator/dashboard` 
2. Go to analytics section
3. Select a specific incident from the dropdown
4. Verify left panel shows incident-specific data (not global aggregates)
5. Check browser network tab to confirm API calls return filtered data

### 4. API Testing
```bash
# Test the analytics API directly
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/monitoring/analytics/incidents/[INCIDENT_ID]/summary
```

## Quality Validation

### Data Quality Checklist
- [ ] Left panel shows different data for different incidents
- [ ] Population impact numbers are incident-specific
- [ ] API returns empty arrays for incidents with no associated entities
- [ ] Preliminary assessment data is properly aggregated
- [ ] No console errors in browser developer tools

### Performance Validation  
- [ ] API response times under 500ms for typical incident data
- [ ] Database queries use proper indexes (consider adding for `incidentId` fields)
- [ ] No N+1 query problems in Prisma queries

## Rollback Plan

If issues arise, revert in this order:

1. **API changes**: Restore original `route.ts` with global data queries
2. **DatabaseService**: Restore TODO comments and global queries  
3. **Schema**: Remove foreign key fields and relationships
4. **Migration**: Run `npx prisma migrate reset` (WARNING: destroys data)

## Future Improvements

1. **Add database indexes** on new foreign key fields for performance
2. **Implement caching** for frequently accessed incident data
3. **Add data validation** to ensure referential integrity
4. **Create background jobs** to auto-link assessments to incidents based on location/time proximity
