# Story 3.6: API Endpoints Implementation - QA Verification Report

## Summary

**STATUS: ✅ VERIFIED - IMPLEMENTATION COMPLETE**

All three missing API endpoints specified in the dev instructions have been successfully implemented and tested. The implementation follows Next.js 15 App Router best practices and integrates seamlessly with the existing Story 3.6 incident management system.

## Implementation Verification

### 1. ✅ Stats Endpoint Implementation
**File:** `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/incidents/stats/route.ts`

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/stats
# Returns: {"success":true,"data":{"stats":{"totalIncidents":3,"activeIncidents":2,"highPriorityIncidents":2,...}}}
```

**Features Implemented:**
- Complete statistics calculation from mock incident data
- Proper Next.js App Router structure with GET export
- Comprehensive error handling with 500 status codes
- Response format matches existing API patterns
- Statistics include: totalIncidents, activeIncidents, highPriorityIncidents, recentlyUpdated, byType, bySeverity, byStatus

### 2. ✅ Individual Incident Details Endpoint
**File:** `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/incidents/[id]/route.ts`

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-1  # Returns 200 with detailed incident data
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-2  # Returns 200 with fire incident data
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-3  # Returns 200 with landslide incident data
```

**Features Implemented:**
- Dynamic route handling with proper Next.js 15+ async params pattern
- Comprehensive incident details including:
  - Basic info (name, type, severity, status, description)
  - Affected entities with full entity objects
  - Preliminary assessments with verification status
  - Action items with status tracking
  - Timeline events with metadata
  - Coordinates and creation timestamps
- Full CRUD support (GET, PATCH, DELETE methods)
- Proper TypeScript integration with @dms/shared types
- Error handling for invalid IDs and non-existent incidents

### 3. ✅ Timeline Endpoint Implementation
**File:** `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/incidents/[id]/timeline/route.ts`

**Verification:**
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-1/timeline  # Returns detailed timeline
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-2/timeline  # Returns fire incident timeline
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/incident-3/timeline  # Returns landslide timeline
```

**Features Implemented:**
- Comprehensive timeline events with proper typing
- Status history tracking with duration calculations
- Advanced filtering by event type and timestamp
- Pagination support with offset/limit
- Timeline statistics and metadata
- POST endpoint for adding manual timeline events
- Rich event types: STATUS_CHANGE, ENTITY_LINKED, ASSESSMENT_ADDED, NOTE_ADDED
- Coordinator activity tracking

## Error Handling Verification

### ✅ 404 Error Handling
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/nonexistent-id  # Returns 404
# Response: {"success":false,"error":"Incident not found","message":"No incident found with ID: nonexistent-id"}

curl http://localhost:3000/api/v1/incidents/nonexistent-id/timeline  # Returns 404
# Response: {"success":false,"error":"Timeline not found","details":"No timeline found for incident ID: nonexistent-id"}
```

### ✅ Input Validation
- Empty or invalid incident IDs return 400 Bad Request
- JSON parsing errors return 400 with helpful messages
- All endpoints follow consistent error response format

## Integration Verification

### ✅ Frontend Store Integration
The existing incident store (`src/stores/incident.store.ts`) is already properly configured to work with these endpoints:

- `fetchIncidentDetail()` calls `/api/v1/incidents/${incidentId}` ✅
- `fetchIncidentTimeline()` calls `/api/v1/incidents/${incidentId}/timeline` ✅  
- `refreshStats()` calls `/api/v1/incidents/stats` ✅

### ✅ UI Component Integration
The incident management interface (`src/components/features/incident/IncidentManagementInterface.tsx`) correctly:

- Displays stats from the stats endpoint in dashboard cards
- Uses "View Details" buttons that call the incident details endpoint
- Shows timeline events in the preview dialog
- Handles loading states and errors properly
- Includes refresh functionality that calls all endpoints

### ✅ Response Format Consistency
All endpoints return responses in the expected format:
```typescript
{
  success: boolean;
  data?: any;
  error?: string;
  message?: string;
  timestamp?: string;
}
```

## Technical Implementation Quality

### ✅ Next.js 15 App Router Best Practices
- Proper async params handling: `const { id } = await params;`
- Correct file structure in `app/api/v1/` directory
- Named exports for HTTP methods (GET, POST, PATCH, DELETE)
- Proper use of NextRequest and NextResponse

### ✅ TypeScript Integration
- Full integration with `@dms/shared` types
- Proper enum usage (IncidentType, IncidentSeverity, IncidentStatus)
- Type-safe response structures
- Strong typing for mock data structures

### ✅ Error Handling
- Comprehensive try-catch blocks
- Proper HTTP status codes (200, 400, 404, 500)
- User-friendly error messages
- Console logging for debugging
- Graceful handling of edge cases

### ✅ Mock Data Quality
- Realistic incident scenarios (Borno State Flood, Maiduguri Market Fire, Adamawa Landslide)
- Comprehensive data coverage including:
  - Multiple incident types and severities
  - Detailed affected entity information
  - Realistic assessment data with proper verification status
  - Action items with proper priority and status tracking
  - Rich timeline events with coordinator information
- Data consistency across all endpoints

## Performance Verification

### ✅ Response Times
Manual testing shows acceptable response times:
- `/api/v1/incidents/stats`: ~200-600ms (includes calculation)
- `/api/v1/incidents/[id]`: ~250-900ms (detailed data)
- `/api/v1/incidents/[id]/timeline`: ~250-900ms (with filtering)

### ✅ Error Response Times
- 404 responses: ~250-450ms (proper validation)
- 400 responses: <200ms (immediate validation)

## Migration Path Confirmed

The implementation includes clear TODO comments for production migration:
- Replace mock data with actual database queries
- Implement proper authentication and authorization
- Add audit trail functionality
- Connect to actual entity and assessment services
