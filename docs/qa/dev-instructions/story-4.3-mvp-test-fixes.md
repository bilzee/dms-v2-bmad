# Story 4.3 MVP Test Fixes - Dev Instructions

## Overview
✅ **COMPLETED** - QA validation confirmed Story 4.3 MVP implementation is functional. Test suite has been updated to match actual MVP implementation.

## ✅ Critical Fixes COMPLETED

### 1. ConflictResolver Test Updates ✅ FIXED
**File:** `packages/frontend/src/components/features/sync/__tests__/ConflictResolver.test.tsx`

**Fixes Applied:**
```typescript
// FIXED:
expect(screen.getByText('Conflict Resolution Center (MVP)')).toBeInTheDocument();
```

**Test Expectations Updated:**
- ✅ Line 105: Updated text expectation to include "(MVP)" suffix
- ✅ Statistics expectations aligned with mock data (2, 1, 5, 7)
- ✅ Justification placeholder text updated to "Optional:" prefix

### 2. Test Data Alignment ✅ FIXED
**Fixed placeholder text expectations:**
```typescript
// FIXED:
screen.getByPlaceholderText('Optional: Explain why this resolution was chosen...')
```

### 3. Resolution Strategy Test Validation ✅ VERIFIED
**These tests are now passing:**
- ✅ Only LOCAL_WINS and SERVER_WINS options present
- ✅ No MERGE/MANUAL options displayed
- ✅ Justification is optional, not mandatory
- ✅ Resolution works without requiring justification

### 4. TypeScript Type Fixes (Non-blocking but recommended)
**Files with type errors (not Story 4.3 related):**
- `DeliveryPhotoCapture.test.tsx` - Remove 'filename' property from MediaAttachment
- Verification component tests - Fix MediaAttachment metadata typing
- Response accountability tests - Fix deprecated property references

## Test Commands to Run After Fixes

```bash
# Test ConflictResolver specifically
pnpm --filter @dms/frontend test ConflictResolver.test.tsx

# Run typecheck (will show remaining non-critical errors)
pnpm --filter @dms/frontend typecheck

# Verify dev server still works
npm run dev
```
