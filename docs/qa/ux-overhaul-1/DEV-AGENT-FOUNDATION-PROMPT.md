# ü§ñ **DEV AGENT EXECUTION PROMPT**

## üéØ **MISSION**
Implement the **Foundation Phase** of the UX overhaul to transform the current "horrible" UI into a professional humanitarian software interface.

---

## üìã **EXECUTION SEQUENCE**

### **PHASE 1: FOUNDATION (6-8 hours total)**

Execute these instruction files **IN ORDER**:

#### **STEP 1: Navigation Architecture (2-3 hours)**
```
File: docs/qa/ux-overhaul-1/01-sidebar-layout.md
Priority: CRITICAL - Required infrastructure for multi-story app
Focus: Implement ONLY the sidebar components, NOT the advanced features
```

#### **STEP 2: Component Standardization (2-3 hours)**
```
File: docs/qa/ux-overhaul-1/04-card-redesign.md  
Priority: HIGH - Visual improvement without complexity
Focus: Implement ONLY the basic card components, SKIP the gradient animations
```

#### **STEP 3: Integration & Testing (1-2 hours)**
```
Task: Update root layout and homepage to use new components
Test: Ensure all existing functionality works
Verify: Professional appearance achieved
```

## üö® **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS**

### **‚úÖ DO IMPLEMENT:**
- Collapsible sidebar with basic navigation
- shadcn/ui Card, Button, Badge components properly
- Humanitarian color scheme (Emergency Red #DC2626, UN Blue #0066CC, Relief Green #059669)
- Basic responsive layout structure
- Professional header with connection status

### **‚ùå DO NOT IMPLEMENT YET:**
- Micro-animations and hover effects (from 07-micro-animations.md)
- Advanced mobile optimizations (from 10-mobile-sidebar.md)
- Complex responsive systems (from 11-responsive-design.md)
- Loading skeletons and advanced states
- Gradient backgrounds and advanced visual effects

---

## üéØ **SUCCESS CRITERIA**

After implementation, the interface should have:
- ‚úÖ **Professional navigation sidebar** that can be collapsed/expanded
- ‚úÖ **Role-based navigation sections** with proper routing
- ‚úÖ **Clean card layouts** using shadcn/ui components
- ‚úÖ **Humanitarian color scheme** throughout the interface
- ‚úÖ **Professional header** with status indicators
- ‚úÖ **All existing functionality preserved** - zero breaking changes

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è **IMPLEMENTATION NOTES**

1. **Start with 01-sidebar-layout.md first** - This is the architectural foundation
2. **Use the component patterns exactly as specified** - Don't modify for now
3. **Focus on functionality over visual polish** - Animations come later
4. **Test thoroughly after each step** - Ensure no existing features break
5. **Skip any "enhancement" or "advanced" sections** - Foundation only

---

## üîç **TESTING CHECKLIST**

Before marking complete, verify:
- [ ] Sidebar toggles open/closed correctly
- [ ] Navigation items work and highlight active page
- [ ] All assessment type links functional
- [ ] Cards use proper shadcn/ui components
- [ ] Colors follow humanitarian palette
- [ ] Responsive design works on mobile/desktop
- [ ] No existing functionality broken
- [ ] Professional appearance achieved

---

## üéâ **EXPECTED OUTCOME**

Interface transformation:
- **BEFORE**: "Horrible" basic HTML with custom CSS
- **AFTER**: Professional humanitarian software with proper navigation

This foundation will make ALL future story development automatically look professional without additional UI work per story.

---

## üöÄ **POST-COMPLETION**

After Foundation is complete and tested:
1. Continue with normal story development 
2. All new pages will automatically use the professional foundation
3. Polish phase (advanced animations, mobile optimization) comes AFTER stories are complete
