## üö® **CRITICAL IMPLEMENTATION CONSTRAINTS**

### **‚úÖ ENHANCEMENT RULES:**
- **Build on Foundation**: Enhance existing components, don't replace
- **Preserve Functionality**: Zero breaking changes to working features
- **Performance First**: All animations must run at 60fps
- **Mobile Priority**: Field worker experience is critical
- **Accessibility**: Maintain WCAG AA compliance throughout

### **‚ùå AVOID:**
- Completely rewriting existing working components
- Adding animations that impact core functionality performance
- Making mobile experience secondary to desktop
- Breaking existing user workflows or navigation patterns

---

- ‚úÖ **Professional branding** worthy of humanitarian organizations

### **Phase 2 Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **Smooth micro-animations** enhancing user interactions
- ‚úÖ **Interactive assessment grid** with engaging hover states
- ‚úÖ **Advanced status system** with pulse and priority indicators
- ‚úÖ **60fps performance** maintained on target devices

### **Phase 3 Complete:**
- ‚úÖ **Premium mobile navigation** optimized for field workers
- ‚úÖ **Touch-friendly interactions** with appropriate feedback
- ‚úÖ **Device-specific optimizations** across all breakpoints
- ‚úÖ **Progressive PWA features** for offline/online state management
