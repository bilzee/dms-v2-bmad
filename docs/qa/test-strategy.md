# Early Test Strategy - Disaster Management PWA

## Executive Summary

This early test strategy establishes a comprehensive quality framework for the Disaster Management PWA before development begins. Given the **mission-critical nature** of humanitarian coordination and the **high-risk offline-first architecture**, this strategy prioritizes data integrity, reliability, and field-ready performance.

### Risk-Based Approach
- **P0 Critical:** Zero data loss, offline functionality, sync reliability
- **P1 High:** Role-based security, field performance, cross-platform compatibility
- **P2 Medium:** UI/UX consistency, advanced features, optimization

### Success Metrics Alignment
- **Data Integrity:** Zero tolerance for data loss during Assessment→Coordination→Response handoffs
- **Performance:** <3s load time, <30s dashboard updates, 100% offline core functionality
- **Reliability:** >99.5% system uptime, >98% sync success rate
