/**
 * Comprehensive User Authentication Test Script
 * 
 * This script tests all user login scenarios using Playwright MCP
 * to identify authentication, navigation, and role-based access issues.
 * 
 * Test Users from auth.config.ts:
 * - admin@test.com / admin123 (ADMIN)
 * - assessor@test.com / assessor123 (ASSESSOR) 
 * - responder@test.com / responder123 (RESPONDER)
 * - coordinator@test.com / coordinator123 (COORDINATOR)
 * - verifier@test.com / verifier123 (VERIFIER)
 * 
 * Issues to investigate:
 * 1. Landing page links show "missing required error components, refreshing..."
 * 2. No sign out link when logged in as Admin
 * 3. Admin sees "404 | This page cannot be found" after login
 * 4. Verify user role assignments and expected functionality
 * 
 * Usage Instructions:
 * 1. Start dev server: pnpm --filter @dms/frontend dev
 * 2. Run this script through QA agent with Playwright MCP
