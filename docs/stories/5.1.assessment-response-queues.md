## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on completed Stories 4.1-4.4:
- **Story 4.1**: Priority-based sync infrastructure provides queue prioritization foundation
- **Story 4.2**: Background sync manager enables automatic real-time updates for dashboard
- **Story 4.3**: Basic conflict resolution (LOCAL_WINS/SERVER_WINS) ensures data consistency for verification status
- **Story 4.4**: Optimistic UI updates provide immediate feedback for verify/reject actions with <100ms response time
- **Stories 3.2-3.5**: Complete verification workflow and auto-approval system ready for dashboard integration

### Data Models
**Verification System Data** [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]:
```typescript
// Core verification status enum
export enum VerificationStatus {
  PENDING = 'PENDING',
  VERIFIED = 'VERIFIED',
  AUTO_VERIFIED = 'AUTO_VERIFIED',
  REJECTED = 'REJECTED'
}

// Verification tracking model
export interface Verification {
  id: string;
  assessmentId?: string;
  responseId?: string;
  verifierId: string;
  status: VerificationStatus;
  notes?: string;
  autoVerified: boolean;
  ruleId?: string; // References AutoVerificationRule if auto-verified
  createdAt: Date;
}

// Assessment and Response models with verification status
export interface RapidAssessment {
  id: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus;
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  // ... other fields
}

export interface RapidResponse {
  id: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus;
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  // ... other fields
}
```

**Queue Management Data Structures**:
```typescript
// Dashboard queue item interface
export interface QueueItem {
  id: string;
  type: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE';
  entityId: string;
  entityName: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus;
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  submittedDate: Date;
  submitterName: string;
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'NORMAL' | 'LOW';
  waitingTime: number; // milliseconds
}

// Bottleneck metrics
export interface QueueMetrics {
  totalPending: number;
  averageProcessingTime: number;
  queueVelocity: number; // items per hour
  bottleneckThreshold: number;
  isBottleneck: boolean;
  trendDirection: 'UP' | 'DOWN' | 'STABLE';
}
```
