- Photo capture component: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/DeliveryPhotoCapture.tsx`
- Beneficiary verification: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/BeneficiaryVerification.tsx`
- GPS delivery stamp: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/GPSDeliveryStamp.tsx`
- Extended response store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/response.store.ts` (add delivery documentation actions)

**Integration Files**:
- Delivery documentation page: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/responses/[id]/delivery/page.tsx`
- Delivery API endpoints: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/responses/[id]/delivery/route.ts`
- Completion API endpoint: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/responses/[id]/complete/route.ts`
- Documentation details API: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/responses/[id]/documentation/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/response/DeliveryDocumentationForm.test.tsx`
- Mock delivery documentation API endpoints and GPS location services
- Test photo capture functionality and offline storage
- Test beneficiary verification workflows and demographic tracking
- Test GPS location capture and accuracy validation
- Test offline delivery documentation storage and sync
- Test integration with existing response workflow from Stories 2.1-2.3

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB delivery documentation storage
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- GPS: Browser Geolocation API with fallback support
- Media: File API for photo capture and compression

**Security Considerations**:
- Delivery documentation contains sensitive beneficiary information requiring encryption
- Photo evidence requires secure storage and transmission protocols
- GPS coordinates and beneficiary verification data require access controls
- Cross-reference with existing authentication patterns from Epic 1 and previous stories
- Delivery documentation requires audit trail for accountability

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- Implement ErrorBoundary component for delivery documentation form failures
- Offline storage failure recovery patterns for documentation data
- Network timeout handling for delivery documentation API calls
- GPS location failure handling with manual coordinate entry fallback
- Photo capture failure handling with retry mechanisms and error messaging
- Beneficiary verification data validation with clear error feedback

**Delivery Documentation Requirements**:
- Support final status transition from IN_PROGRESS to DELIVERED
- Maintain complete delivery audit trail with timestamps and evidence
- Generate comprehensive delivery reports from documentation data
- Support multiple delivery documentation per response for complex deliveries
- Preserve all delivery documentation history for compliance purposes
- Ensure delivery documentation cannot be lost during offline operations
- Support witness verification for high-value or sensitive deliveries

**Performance Considerations**:
- Optimize photo compression for efficient storage and transmission
- Minimize form re-renders during data entry and GPS location updates
- Efficient storage of delivery documentation for offline scenarios
- Background processing for photo compression and GPS coordinate validation
- Lazy loading of delivery evidence photos in gallery views

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/response/DeliveryDocumentationForm.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: delivery API endpoints, GPS location services, photo capture APIs
- Test coverage requirements: form validation, photo capture, GPS stamping, beneficiary verification, offline storage
