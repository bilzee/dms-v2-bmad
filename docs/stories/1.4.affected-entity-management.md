## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on established patterns from Stories 1.1-1.3:
- GPS capture functionality working with automatic coordinate capture and manual fallback
- IndexedDB with Dexie.js operational with encryption and queue management established
- React Hook Form + Zod validation patterns proven effective
- Auto-save functionality and error handling patterns established
- Offline-first design with priority-based sync operational

### Data Models
**AffectedEntity Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
```typescript
export interface AffectedEntity {
  id: string; // UUID
  type: 'CAMP' | 'COMMUNITY';
  name: string;
  lga: string;
  ward: string;
  longitude: number;
  latitude: number;
  campDetails?: CampDetails;
  communityDetails?: CommunityDetails;
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**CampDetails Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#supporting-types]:
```typescript
export interface CampDetails {
  campName: string;
  campStatus: 'OPEN' | 'CLOSED';
  campCoordinatorName: string;
  campCoordinatorPhone: string;
  superviserName?: string;
  superviserOrganization?: string;
  estimatedPopulation?: number;
}
```

**CommunityDetails Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#supporting-types]:
```typescript
export interface CommunityDetails {
  communityName: string;
  contactPersonName: string;
  contactPersonPhone: string;
  contactPersonRole: string;
  estimatedHouseholds?: number;
}
```

**Assessment-Entity Relationship** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- `RapidAssessment.affectedEntityId: string` links assessments to entities
- Entity creation must support retrospective linking to existing assessments
- Assessment forms must include entity selection or inline entity creation

### API Specifications
**Entity Management Endpoints** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- POST `/api/v1/entities` - Create new affected entity with type-specific details
- PUT `/api/v1/entities/:id` - Update entity baseline information and details
- GET `/api/v1/entities` - List entities with search and filtering capabilities
- GET `/api/v1/entities/:id` - Get specific entity details with linked assessments

**Offline Queue Extensions** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#offline-queue-management]:
- Extend `OfflineQueueItem.type` to include 'ENTITY' for entity operations
- Priority handling: Entity creation HIGH priority due to assessment dependencies
- Conflict resolution: Handle concurrent entity updates with field-level merging

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-organization]:
- EntityManagementForm: `components/features/entity/EntityManagementForm.tsx`
- EntityList: `components/features/entity/EntityList.tsx`
- EntitySelector: `components/features/entity/EntitySelector.tsx` (for assessment forms)
- Follow established form patterns with conditional rendering based on entity type

**Form Integration Pattern** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md#component-implementation-pattern]:
- Use React Hook Form with Zod validation for form management
- Implement conditional field rendering based on CAMP/COMMUNITY selection
- GPS capture integration with existing `GPSCapture` shared component
- Auto-save functionality using established patterns from assessment forms

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Entity form component: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity/EntityManagementForm.tsx`
- Entity types extension: `packages/shared/types/entities.ts` (extend OfflineQueueItem type)
- Entity API endpoints: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/entities/route.ts`
- Entity service: `packages/frontend/src/lib/api/entity.service.ts`

**Integration Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Assessment form integration: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/assessment/AssessmentForm.tsx` (add entity selection)

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-22 (Updated Post Implementation Review)

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Actual Implementation Review Summary

**Story Status: CONCERNS - Critical Test Failures Found**

Following comprehensive examination of actual code implementation rather than just documentation, significant discrepancies have been identified between claimed and actual quality status.

### Code Quality Assessment

**What's Actually Working:**
✅ **Database Schema**: AffectedEntity model properly implemented in `prisma/schema.prisma:69-101` with all required fields  
✅ **API Endpoints**: Real Prisma integration in `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/entities/route.ts` with proper validation  
✅ **Component Architecture**: EntityManagementForm.tsx:1-551 is comprehensive with conditional rendering and GPS integration  
✅ **Environment Setup**: Configuration files (.env, .env.local) exist and properly configured  
✅ **Offline Support**: IndexedDB schema extensions and queue management implemented  

### Critical Issues Identified

❌ **Test Failures**: 2 out of 11 tests failing (NOT 8/8 passing as claimed in documentation)  
- `successfully submits camp entity form` - FAILED  
- `successfully submits community entity form` - FAILED  
- Form submission functionality not working properly in tests  
- Mock configuration issues preventing proper form submission testing  

❌ **Documentation Inaccuracy**: Dev Agent claimed all tests passing when 18% failure rate exists  

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Code follows established patterns and TypeScript conventions
- Project Structure: ✓ Files placed correctly according to architecture guidelines  
- Testing Strategy: ✗ Test failures indicate inadequate test verification before completion
- All ACs Met: ⚠️ Functionality exists but test failures suggest potential runtime issues

### Root Cause Analysis

**Test Failure Pattern**: Form submission tests fail because mock functions (`mockSaveEntity`) are not being called during form submission. This indicates either:
1. Form submission handler not executing properly
2. Mock setup issues in test configuration  
3. Potential runtime issues that would affect real users

**Risk Assessment**: High - If form submission doesn't work in tests, it may not work for real users

### Security Review

✅ **GPS Data Encryption**: AES-256 encryption properly implemented for offline storage  
✅ **Input Validation**: Zod schemas prevent injection attacks  
✅ **Coordinate Validation**: Proper bounds checking prevents invalid GPS data  

### Performance Considerations

✅ **Auto-save**: 30-second intervals prevent data loss  
✅ **Offline Queue**: HIGH priority for entity operations due to assessment dependencies  
✅ **Database Indexing**: Proper foreign key relationships established  

### Gate Status

Gate: CONCERNS → docs/qa/gates/1.4-affected-entity-management.yml

**Status Reason**: Critical test failures indicate form submission functionality may not work properly for users. While core implementation appears sound, test failures must be resolved before production deployment.

### Immediate Actions Required

**Priority 1 - Must Fix Before Production:**
1. **Fix Form Submission Tests**: Debug why form submission tests are failing
   - Check mock configuration in `__tests__/components/features/entity/EntityManagementForm.test.tsx`
   - Verify form submission handler is properly executing
   - Ensure `db.saveEntity` and offline queue operations work correctly

2. **Verify Runtime Functionality**: Test actual form submission in development environment
   - Confirm entity creation works end-to-end
   - Verify offline queue processing
   - Test database persistence

**Priority 2 - Development Process:**
3. **Improve QA Process**: Dev Agent should run all tests before claiming completion
4. **Test Reliability**: Investigate why tests passed previously but fail now

### Files Requiring Investigation

- `__tests__/components/features/entity/EntityManagementForm.test.tsx:175-222` - Form submission test logic  
- `packages/frontend/src/components/features/entity/EntityManagementForm.tsx:175-222` - Form submission handler  
- Mock configuration for `db.saveEntity` and offline store operations  

### Recommended Status

✗ **Changes Required** - Fix test failures and verify form submission functionality before production deployment

**Quality Score**: 72/100 (28 points deducted for test failures and documentation inaccuracy)
