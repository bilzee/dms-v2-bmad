## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on completed Stories 4.1-4.2:
- **Story 4.1**: Priority-based sync infrastructure provides BullMQ job processing and enhanced sync store with priority management
- **Story 4.2**: Background sync manager and connectivity detection services provide foundation for intelligent conflict resolution timing
- **Existing Sync Engine**: Core SyncEngine class already includes basic conflict detection and resolution methods [Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture-details.md:556-669]
- **Background Processing**: Service worker background sync capabilities enable conflict resolution during connectivity windows

### Data Models
**Existing SyncEngine Conflict Infrastructure** [Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture-details.md:612-668]:
```typescript
export class SyncEngine {
  async performSync(deviceId: string, userId: string, changes: any[]): Promise<SyncResult> {
    const results = { successful: [], conflicts: [], failed: [] };
    // Returns conflicts array for processing
  }
  
  private async processChange(change: any, deviceId: string, userId: string): Promise<any> {
    // Timestamp-based conflict detection: serverVersion.updatedAt > change.updatedAt
    if (serverVersion && serverVersion.updatedAt > change.updatedAt) {
      return {
        status: 'CONFLICT',
        entityId: change.entityId,
        localVersion: change,
        serverVersion: serverVersion,
      };
    }
  }
  
  async resolveConflict(entityId: string, resolution: ConflictResolution, data?: any): Promise<void> {
    // Supports LOCAL_WINS, SERVER_WINS, MERGE resolution strategies
  }
}
```

**NEW: Enhanced Conflict Resolution Data Structures**:
```typescript
export interface ConflictDetailed {
  id: string; // UUID
  entityType: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE' | 'ENTITY';
  entityId: string;
  conflictType: 'TIMESTAMP' | 'FIELD_LEVEL' | 'CONCURRENT_EDIT';
  severity: 'LOW' | 'MEDIUM' | 'HIGH' | 'CRITICAL'; // See severity examples below
  localVersion: any;
  serverVersion: any;
  conflictFields?: string[]; // Field-level conflict identification
  detectedAt: Date;
  detectedBy: string; // User ID
  status: 'PENDING' | 'RESOLVED' | 'ESCALATED';
  resolutionStrategy?: 'LOCAL_WINS' | 'SERVER_WINS' | 'MERGE' | 'MANUAL';
  resolvedBy?: string; // Coordinator ID
  resolvedAt?: Date;
  resolutionJustification?: string;
  auditTrail: ConflictAuditEntry[];
}

// Conflict Severity Classification Examples:
// LOW: Minor field updates (tags, notes) with recent timestamps
// MEDIUM: Important field conflicts (status, priority) affecting workflow
// HIGH: Critical data conflicts (assessment scores, response assignments) requiring immediate attention
// CRITICAL: System integrity conflicts (entity relationships, audit trail) that could cause data corruption

export interface ConflictAuditEntry {
  timestamp: Date;
  action: string;
  performedBy: string;
  details: any;
}

export interface ConflictResolutionRequest {
  conflictId: string;
  resolutionStrategy: ConflictResolution;
  mergedData?: any; // For MERGE strategy
  justification: string;
  coordinatorId: string;
}
```

- ✅ SyncEngine.ts (604+ lines) - Enhanced conflict detection engine

**2. Component Quality Assessment:**
- ✅ **ConflictResolver**: Feature-complete with filtering, statistics, resolution strategies
- ✅ **API Coverage**: All documented endpoints (queue, details, resolve, override, audit)
- ✅ **Type Safety**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for ConflictDetailed, ConflictResolution
- ✅ **UI/UX Excellence**: Professional coordinator interface with severity badges and real-time updates

### 🚨 **CRITICAL INTEGRATION FAILURES**

**1. Route Accessibility Crisis:**
- ❌ **404 Error**: `/coordinator/conflicts` page returns 404 despite file existence
- ❌ **Navigation Broken**: Sidebar menu exists but leads to non-functional route
- **Live Test Result:** Playwright navigation fails with "404: This page could not be found"

**2. Test Infrastructure Collapse:**  
- ❌ **SyncEngine Tests:** 6 FAIL / 13 PASS (68% pass rate)
  - ✅ Resolution strategies functional (LOCAL_WINS, SERVER_WINS, MERGE, MANUAL)
  - ✅ Audit trail creation works
  - ❌ **Critical Failure:** Conflict detection algorithms return empty arrays
  - ❌ **Mock Issues:** fetch mocking prevents proper conflict detection testing
- ❌ **ConflictResolver Tests:** Cannot run due to Jest path resolution
  - Error: `Could not locate module @/components/ui/use-toast`

**3. Integration Quality Matrix:**

| Component | File Status | Functionality | User Access | Test Status |
|-----------|-------------|---------------|-------------|-------------|
| ConflictResolver | ✅ Exists | ✅ Complete | ❌ 404 Route | ❌ Cannot Test |
| SyncEngine Core | ✅ Exists | ⚠️ Partial | N/A | ❌ 68% Pass |
| API Endpoints | ✅ All 5 Exist | ✅ Complete | ❌ Untested | ❌ Cannot Test |
| Navigation Menu | ✅ Exists | ❌ Broken Link | ❌ 404 Target | N/A |
| Dashboard Integration | ❌ Missing | ❌ None | ❌ No Access | N/A |

### 🎯 **REVISED ASSESSMENT: 75% COMPLETE → BLOCKED**

**Technical Implementation Quality: EXCELLENT (90%)**
- Sophisticated 478-line ConflictResolver with advanced filtering and comparison
- Complete API suite with proper validation and error handling
- Enhanced SyncEngine with field-level conflict detection and severity classification
- Professional TypeScript interfaces and state management

**User Accessibility: FAILED (0%)**
- Route exists but returns 404 error
- No working path for coordinators to access conflict resolution
- Navigation menu leads to broken route

**Testing Validation: FAILED (35%)**
- Core conflict detection algorithms cannot be validated (tests return empty results)
- Component tests blocked by Jest configuration issues
- 13/19 tests pass but critical functionality untested

### 🚨 **PRODUCTION READINESS: NOT READY**

**Status Change:** COMPLETED ✅ → **BLOCKED - CRITICAL FIXES REQUIRED** ❌

**Critical Issues Requiring Immediate Fix:**
1. **Route Configuration:** `/coordinator/conflicts` page not accessible despite existing
2. **Test Environment:** Jest path mapping prevents component validation  
3. **Conflict Detection:** Core algorithms return empty results in tests
4. **Dashboard Missing:** No conflict resolution section in coordinator dashboard

### 🛠️ **IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED**

**Estimated Fix Time:** 6-8 hours of focused development
- Route accessibility debugging: 2-3 hours
- Jest configuration fixes: 2-3 hours
- SyncEngine fetch mocking resolution: 1-2 hours
- Dashboard integration: 1 hour

**Recommendation:** 
Story 4.3 demonstrates **exceptional technical sophistication** with production-quality components and APIs, but **critical integration failures** prevent any user access or validation. The implementation quality is excellent, requiring only infrastructure fixes for full functionality.
