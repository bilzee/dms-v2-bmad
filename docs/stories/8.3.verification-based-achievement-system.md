## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on completed donor performance tracking from Story 8.2:
- **Performance Foundation**: Leverage existing donor performance metrics and dashboard
- **Achievement Integration**: Build on existing achievement system with verification-based triggers
- **API Foundation**: Extend existing donor API endpoints with verification-linked achievements
- **Component Integration**: Integrate with existing donor dashboard and performance components
- **Database Schema**: Use existing Donor, DonorCommitment, DonorAchievement, and RapidResponse relationships

### Data Models
**Verification-Based Achievement Models** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md#donor-models]:
```typescript
// Extend existing DonorAchievement model for verification-based achievements
export interface DonorAchievement {
  id: string; // From schema
  donorId: string;
  donor: Donor;
  type: string; // FIRST_VERIFIED_DELIVERY, VERIFICATION_STREAK_10, etc.
  title: string;
  description: string;
  earnedAt: Date;
  // New fields for verification tracking
  verificationId?: string; // Link to triggering verification
  responseId?: string; // Link to verified response
  verificationRate?: number; // For verification success badges
}

// Achievement Rule Engine
export interface AchievementRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  type: 'DELIVERY_MILESTONE' | 'VERIFICATION_SUCCESS' | 'IMPACT_ACHIEVEMENT' | 'RESPONSE_SPECIALIZATION';
  trigger: 'RESPONSE_VERIFIED' | 'COMMITMENT_DELIVERED' | 'PERFORMANCE_THRESHOLD';
  conditions: {
    deliveryCount?: number;
    verificationRate?: number;
    responseTypes?: ResponseType[];
    beneficiariesHelped?: number;
    timeframe?: number; // days
  };
  badge: {
    title: string;
    description: string;
    icon: string;
    color: string;
  };
}
```

**Verification-Response Linking** [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]:
- Use existing RapidResponse model with donor attribution (donorId, donorName fields)
- Link verified responses (verificationStatus: 'VERIFIED') to achievement calculation triggers
- Support both registered donor profiles and ad-hoc donor name attribution
- Extract beneficiary data from response.data field for impact achievement calculations

### **Critical Errors Encountered and Resolutions**

#### **Error 1: Next.js 14 Server Component Restrictions**
**Problem**: Components using `useState` and `useEffect` failed to render with "You're importing a component that needs useState" errors
**Root Cause**: Next.js 14 App Router defaults to Server Components which cannot use React hooks
**Resolution**: Added `"use client";` directive to all interactive components
**Files Fixed**:
- `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/AchievementBadges.tsx`
- `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/AchievementLeaderboard.tsx`  
- `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/AchievementNotifications.tsx`

#### **Error 2: Missing Route Implementation**
**Problem**: E2E tests failing with 404 errors for `/dashboard/donor/leaderboard`
**Root Cause**: Leaderboard page component not implemented despite being referenced in navigation
**Resolution**: Created complete leaderboard page with proper structure and component integration
**Files Created**:
- `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/donor/leaderboard/page.tsx`

#### **Error 3: Navigation Discovery Gap**
**Problem**: Achievement pages inaccessible through UI navigation despite existing as pages
**Root Cause**: No navigation menu items configured for achievement and leaderboard access
**Resolution**: Added role-based navigation items to DONOR sidebar section with proper icons and permissions
**Files Modified**:
- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useRoleNavigation.ts` (lines 332-344)

#### **Error 4: URL Path Mismatch**
**Problem**: Navigation URLs pointed to `/donor/*` while actual pages located at `/dashboard/donor/*`
**Root Cause**: Inconsistent routing patterns between navigation configuration and page structure
**Resolution**: Updated navigation href paths to match actual page locations and updated e2e tests accordingly
**Files Modified**:
- `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useRoleNavigation.ts` (corrected href paths)
- `packages/frontend/src/e2e/__tests__/story-8.3-verification-based-achievement-system.e2e.test.ts` (updated test URLs)
