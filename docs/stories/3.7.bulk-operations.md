interface BatchOperationRequest {
  targetIds: string[];
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  operation: 'APPROVE' | 'REJECT';
  batchNote?: string;
  notifyTargets: boolean;
}

interface BatchOperationResponse {
  success: boolean;
  data: {
    processed: number;
    successful: number;
    failed: number;
    results: Array<{
      id: string;
      status: 'SUCCESS' | 'FAILED';
      error?: string;
    }>;

## API Specifications

### Batch Assessment Approval
```http
POST /api/v1/verification/assessments/batch-approve
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "assessmentIds": ["uuid1", "uuid2", ...],
  "coordinatorId": "coord-uuid",
  "coordinatorName": "Coordinator Name",
  "batchNote": "Optional batch approval note",
  "notifyAssessors": true
