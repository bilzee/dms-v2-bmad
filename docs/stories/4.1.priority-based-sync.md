## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on Epic 3 completion (Coordinator Verification Workflow):
- Comprehensive verification workflow patterns established
- API endpoint patterns standardized for queue management
- Integration with existing store patterns proven for state management
- Background job processing infrastructure (BullMQ) already established for sync operations
- Conflict resolution patterns established in sync engine

### Data Models
**Existing OfflineQueueItem Model** [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md:295-306]:
```typescript
export interface OfflineQueueItem {
  id: string; // Local UUID
  type: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE' | 'MEDIA';
  action: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  entityId?: string; // Server ID if updating
  data: any; // The actual data to sync
  retryCount: number;
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'NORMAL' | 'LOW'; // Existing basic priority system
  createdAt: Date;
  lastAttempt?: Date;
  error?: string;
}
```

**NEW: Enhanced Priority System Data Structures**:
```typescript
// Enhanced priority queue management
export interface PriorityQueueItem extends OfflineQueueItem {
  priorityScore: number; // 0-100 calculated priority score
  priorityReason: string; // Why this priority was assigned
  manualOverride?: {
    coordinatorId: string;
    coordinatorName: string;
    originalPriority: number;
    overridePriority: number;
    justification: string;
    timestamp: Date;
  };
  estimatedSyncTime?: Date; // When this item will likely sync
}

// Priority rule configuration
export interface PriorityRule {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  entityType: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE' | 'MEDIA';
  conditions: PriorityCondition[];
  priorityModifier: number; // +/- points to base priority
  isActive: boolean;
  createdBy: string;
  createdAt: Date;
}

export interface PriorityCondition {
  field: string; // e.g., 'data.assessmentType', 'data.beneficiariesAffected'
  operator: 'EQUALS' | 'GREATER_THAN' | 'CONTAINS' | 'IN_ARRAY';
  value: any;
  modifier: number; // Priority points for this condition
}

// Priority analytics and monitoring
export interface PriorityQueueStats {
  totalItems: number;
  highPriorityItems: number;
  normalPriorityItems: number;
  lowPriorityItems: number;
  averageWaitTime: number;
  longestWaitingItem: {
    id: string;
    waitTime: number;
    priority: number;
  };
  syncThroughput: {
    itemsPerMinute: number;
    successRate: number;
  };
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Background Jobs: BullMQ 5.7.x for priority queue processing
- Queue Management: Redis 7.2.x for priority queue storage and analytics
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for priority rule validation
- Real-time Updates: Server-sent events or WebSockets for queue status updates

**Performance Considerations**:
- Efficient priority calculation algorithms for large queue datasets
- Caching of priority rules to avoid repeated database queries
- Optimized priority queue sorting and processing
- Real-time updates without overwhelming client connections
- Background processing of priority recalculation jobs

**Integration with Existing Sync Engine** [Source: docs/architecture/10-backend-architecture-details.md:556-669]:
- Extend existing SyncEngine class with priority-based processing
- Maintain compatibility with existing conflict resolution
- Preserve existing sync token and state management
- Enhance existing BullMQ worker configuration for priority processing
- Integrate with existing sync logging and audit trails

**Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms**:
- **Priority Rule Failures**:
  - Fallback to default priority when rule evaluation fails
  - Clear error messaging for invalid rule configurations
  - Rule validation before activation
- **Priority Override Failures**:
  - Preserve original priority queue order on override failure
  - Audit trail for failed override attempts
  - Coordinator notification for override conflicts
- **Queue Processing Errors**:
  - Graceful degradation to FIFO processing when priority engine fails
  - Priority queue recovery mechanisms
  - Performance monitoring and alerting for queue backlogs

**Security Considerations**:
- **Input Validation & Rule Security**:
  - Strict validation of priority rule conditions to prevent injection attacks
  - Rate limiting for rule creation and modification (max 10 rules per coordinator per hour)
  - Rule complexity limits to prevent resource exhaustion (max 5 conditions per rule)
  - Sanitization of rule names and descriptions
- **Data Protection & Privacy**:
  - Encrypted storage of sensitive assessment data in priority queue
  - Audit logging of all priority changes with coordinator identification
  - Data retention policies for priority analytics (30 days max)
  - GDPR compliance for beneficiary data in emergency assessments
- **Access Control & Authorization**:
  - Role-based access for priority rule management (coordinators only)
  - Multi-factor authentication required for manual priority overrides
  - Session timeout enforcement for priority management interfaces
  - IP allowlisting for priority rule configuration endpoints
- **Attack Prevention**:
  - DoS protection via rule evaluation timeout limits (max 1 second per rule)
  - Prevention of priority manipulation through rule flooding
  - Monitoring for suspicious priority override patterns
  - Resource limits for concurrent priority calculations

**UI/UX Design Specifications**:
- **Accessibility Requirements**:
  - WCAG 2.1 AA compliance for all priority management interfaces
  - Keyboard navigation support for priority queue operations
  - Screen reader compatibility with priority status announcements
  - High contrast mode support for priority level indicators
  - Focus management for modal dialogs (ManualPriorityOverride)
- **Responsive Design**:
  - Mobile-first approach with touch-optimized priority controls
  - Tablet layout adaptations for priority rule drag-and-drop
  - Desktop optimization for complex priority analytics dashboards
  - Breakpoints: 320px (mobile), 768px (tablet), 1024px (desktop)
- **Visual Design System**:
  - Priority level color coding: Critical (red), High (orange), Normal (blue), Low (gray)
  - Consistent iconography for priority indicators and actions
  - Loading states and skeleton screens for priority queue updates
  - Toast notifications for priority changes with undo capabilities
- **User Interaction Flows**:
  - **Priority Rule Creation**: Wizard-based flow with validation at each step
  - **Manual Override Process**: Confirmation dialog → Justification → Authorization → Execution
  - **Queue Monitoring**: Real-time updates with filtering and sorting capabilities
  - **Error Recovery**: Clear error messaging with suggested remediation actions

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/qa/test-strategy.md]:

- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: priority calculation engine, sync queues, analytics services
- Test coverage requirements: priority assignment, rule evaluation, queue processing, override functionality

**Priority Sync Testing Scenarios**:
- **Priority Rule Testing**: Test rule creation, condition evaluation, priority calculation, rule conflicts
- **Automatic Priority Assignment**: Test health emergency detection, severity scoring, location-based priorities
- **Manual Override Testing**: Test coordinator authorization, override justification, audit trail creation
- **Queue Processing**: Test priority-based queue ordering, throughput optimization, failover scenarios
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Process 10,000 mixed-priority queue items: <30 seconds
  - Priority recalculation for 1,000 items: <5 seconds
  - Real-time queue updates: <2 second latency
  - Priority rule evaluation: <100ms per item
- **Integration Testing**: Test end-to-end priority sync workflows with existing sync infrastructure
