## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on Epic 2 completion (Stories 2.1-2.5):
- Response verification patterns established with Feedback interface and ResubmissionLog systems
- VerificationStatus enum already in use (PENDING/VERIFIED/AUTO_VERIFIED/REJECTED)
- Generic Feedback system supports both assessments and responses with targetType field
- Coordinator workflow patterns proven with response status review components
- Offline storage patterns established with IndexedDB and Dexie.js for verification data

### Data Models
**RapidAssessment Interface** [Source: packages/shared/types/entities.ts:31-45]:
```typescript
// EXISTING RapidAssessment interface - no modifications needed
export interface RapidAssessment {
  id: string; // UUID
  type: AssessmentType;
  date: Date;
  affectedEntityId: string;
  assessorName: string;
  assessorId: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus; // PENDING/VERIFIED/AUTO_VERIFIED/REJECTED
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  offlineId?: string;
  data: AssessmentData; // Polymorphic based on type
  mediaAttachments: MediaAttachment[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**Feedback Interface for Assessment Verification** [Source: packages/shared/types/entities.ts:627-642]:
```typescript
// EXISTING Feedback interface - already supports assessments
export interface Feedback {
  id: string;
  targetType: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE';
  targetId: string; // assessmentId when targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  feedbackType: 'REJECTION' | 'CLARIFICATION_REQUEST' | 'APPROVAL_NOTE';
  reason: 'DATA_QUALITY' | 'MISSING_INFO' | 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE' | 'OTHER';
  comments: string;
  priority: 'LOW' | 'NORMAL' | 'HIGH' | 'URGENT';
  requiresResponse: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  isRead: boolean;
  isResolved: boolean;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
}
```

  requiresAttention: boolean;
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW';
}

export interface BatchVerificationRequest {

  assessmentTypes?: AssessmentType[];
  verificationStatus?: VerificationStatus[];
  dateRange?: { start: Date; end: Date };
  priority?: ('HIGH' | 'MEDIUM' | 'LOW')[];
  assessorIds?: string[];
}
```

- Verification API endpoints: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/verification/assessments/route.ts`
- Queue endpoint: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/verification/assessments/queue/route.ts`
- Batch endpoint: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/verification/assessments/batch/route.ts`

**Store Integration**:
- Create new verification store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/verification.store.ts`
- Extend offline store for verification queue caching

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/verification/AssessmentVerificationQueue.test.tsx`
- Mock verification API endpoints and offline storage
- Test queue sorting, filtering, and batch operations
- Test assessment preview functionality and data display
- Test offline verification queue storage and sync
- Test accessibility requirements and keyboard navigation

### Database/Storage Architecture
**Database Schema** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md]:
- Existing RapidAssessment table with verificationStatus field
- Existing Feedback table supports assessments with targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'
- Existing Verification table for audit trail
- Performance indexes already established for verification queries

**Offline Storage Extensions** [Dexie.js Schema]:
```typescript
// EXTEND: packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts
interface OfflineSchema {
  // ... existing tables
  verificationQueue: AssessmentVerificationQueueItem;
  verificationCache: {
    assessmentId: string;
    cachedAt: Date;
    queuePosition: number;
    priority: string;
  };
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB verification queue storage
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Data fetching: SWR or TanStack Query for queue updates and real-time sync

**Performance Considerations**:
- Optimize queue rendering for large assessment datasets with virtualization
- Implement efficient pagination and filtering to handle hundreds of pending assessments
- Cache assessment preview data for offline scenarios
- Background processing for batch verification operations
- Real-time updates for verification status changes

**Security Considerations**:
- Assessment data contains sensitive beneficiary information requiring proper access controls
- Verification actions require audit trail for accountability and compliance
- Cross-reference with role-based access control (Coordinators only)
- Secure handling of batch operations to prevent unauthorized approvals

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/verification/AssessmentVerificationQueue.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: verification API endpoints, offline storage services
- Test coverage requirements: queue operations, batch verification, preview functionality, offline storage
