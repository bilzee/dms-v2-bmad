### Data Models
**RapidResponse Interface** [Source: packages/shared/types/entities.ts:47-68]:
```typescript
// EXISTING RapidResponse interface - no modifications to be made without architectural approval
export interface RapidResponse {
  id: string; // UUID
  responseType: ResponseType;
  status: ResponseStatus; // PLANNED → IN_PROGRESS → DELIVERED
  plannedDate: Date;
  deliveredDate?: Date;
  affectedEntityId: string;
  assessmentId: string;
  responderId: string;
  responderName: string;
  donorId?: string;
  donorName?: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus; // PENDING/VERIFIED/AUTO_VERIFIED/REJECTED
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  offlineId?: string;
  data: ResponseData;
  otherItemsDelivered: { item: string; quantity: number; unit: string }[];
  deliveryEvidence: MediaAttachment[];
  partialDeliveryData?: PartialDeliveryData; // Already exists for partial delivery tracking
  deliveryDocumentation?: DeliveryDocumentation; // Already exists for completion docs  
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}

// APPROVED ARCHITECTURAL DECISION [Architect Review: Winston - 2025-08-24]:
// RapidResponse interface extensions for performance optimization:
// - Add computed fields for UI efficiency (avoid N+1 queries)
// - Minimal impact with optional fields for backward compatibility
// - Separate ResubmissionLog entity for detailed audit trail

// APPROVED: RapidResponse Extensions
export interface RapidResponse {
  // ... existing fields remain unchanged
  feedbackCount?: number; // Computed field for UI efficiency
  lastFeedbackAt?: Date;  // Quick access for sorting/filtering
  requiresAttention: boolean; // Computed from feedback + verification status
}
```

**APPROVED Data Structures for Status Review** [Architect Review: Winston - 2025-08-24]:
```typescript
// APPROVED: Generic Feedback Interface (replaces CoordinatorFeedback)
export interface Feedback {
  id: string;
  targetType: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE';
  targetId: string; // assessmentId or responseId
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  feedbackType: 'REJECTION' | 'CLARIFICATION_REQUEST' | 'APPROVAL_NOTE';
  reason: 'DATA_QUALITY' | 'MISSING_INFO' | 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE' | 'OTHER';
  comments: string;
  priority: 'LOW' | 'NORMAL' | 'HIGH' | 'URGENT';
  requiresResponse: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  isRead: boolean;
  isResolved: boolean;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
}

// ARCHITECTURAL DECISION: Generic feedback system chosen for:
// - DRY Principle: Single feedback system eliminates code duplication
// - Future Extensibility: Can support incident feedback, user feedback, etc.
// - Consistent UX: Same feedback patterns across all entity types
// - Simplified Queries: Single table/collection for all feedback

// MIGRATION PATH: Existing CoordinatorFeedback becomes deprecated, 
// data migrated to Feedback with targetType = 'ASSESSMENT' and targetId = assessmentId

// APPROVED: Resubmission Tracking System
export interface ResubmissionLog {
  id: string;
  responseId: string;
  version: number; // 1, 2, 3...
  previousVersion: number;
  resubmittedBy: string;
  resubmittedAt: Date;
  changesDescription: string;
  addressedFeedbackIds: string[];
  dataChanges: {
    field: string;
    oldValue: any;
    newValue: any;
  }[];
  status: 'PENDING' | 'APPROVED' | 'REJECTED';
}

// ARCHITECTURAL RATIONALE for ResubmissionLog:
// - Audit Trail: Complete resubmission history preserved
// - Version Control: Clear versioning for responses
// - Regulatory Compliance: Detailed change tracking
// - Performance: Separate entity prevents bloated response objects
```

### Database/Storage Architecture
**APPROVED Database Schema** [Architect Review: Winston - 2025-08-24]:

```sql
-- Core Tables:
-- responses (existing - extended with computed fields)
-- feedback (new - replaces coordinator_feedback)  
-- resubmission_logs (new - audit trail)

-- Performance Indexes:
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_target ON feedback(target_type, target_id);
CREATE INDEX idx_feedback_priority ON feedback(priority, created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_responses_attention ON responses(requires_attention, verification_status);
CREATE INDEX idx_responses_status_review ON responses(responder_id, verification_status, updated_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_resubmission_response ON resubmission_logs(response_id, version);
```

**APPROVED Offline Storage Extensions** [Dexie.js Schema]:
```typescript
// EXTEND: packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts
interface OfflineSchema {
  // ... existing tables
  feedback: Feedback;
  resubmissionLogs: ResubmissionLog;
  statusReviewCache: {
    responseId: string;
    feedbackCount: number;
    lastFeedbackAt: Date;
    requiresAttention: boolean;
    lastSync: Date;
  };
}
```

**Migration Strategy**:
1. **Phase 1**: Create new `Feedback` table alongside existing `coordinator_feedback`
2. **Phase 2**: Migrate existing feedback data with `targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'`
3. **Phase 3**: Update assessment components to use new Feedback API
4. **Phase 4**: Deprecate old `coordinator_feedback` table
