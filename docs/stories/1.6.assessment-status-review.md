## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on established patterns from Stories 1.1-1.5:
- Assessment creation and management infrastructure established through previous stories
- IndexedDB with Dexie.js operational with verification status tracking
- Zustand store patterns for assessment and sync management proven effective
- React Hook Form + component patterns established for consistent UI
- Queue management patterns from story 1.5 for handling assessment status updates

### Data Models
**RapidAssessment Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
```typescript
export interface RapidAssessment {
  id: string; // UUID
  type: AssessmentType;
  date: Date;
  affectedEntityId: string;
  assessorName: string;
  assessorId: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus;
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  offlineId?: string;
  data: AssessmentData;
  mediaAttachments: MediaAttachment[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**VerificationStatus Enum** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
```typescript
export enum VerificationStatus {
  PENDING = 'PENDING',
  VERIFIED = 'VERIFIED',
  AUTO_VERIFIED = 'AUTO_VERIFIED', 
  REJECTED = 'REJECTED'
}
```

**Coordinator Feedback Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#offline-queue-management]:
```typescript
export interface CoordinatorFeedback {
  id: string;
  assessmentId: string;
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  reason: 'DATA_QUALITY' | 'MISSING_INFO' | 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'OTHER';
  comments: string;
  createdAt: Date;
  isRead: boolean;
}
```

### API Specifications
**Assessment Status Endpoints** [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
- **GET** `/api/v1/assessments/status` - Retrieve assessments with status filtering
- **GET** `/api/v1/assessments/:id/feedback` - Get coordinator feedback for assessment
- **PUT** `/api/v1/assessments/:id/resubmit` - Resubmit corrected assessment
- **PUT** `/api/v1/assessments/:id/feedback/read` - Mark feedback as read

**Request/Response Formats**:
```typescript
// GET /api/v1/assessments/status?status=REJECTED&userId=123
interface StatusResponse {
  data: RapidAssessment[];
  meta: {
    totalCount: number;
    pendingCount: number;
    rejectedCount: number;
    verifiedCount: number;
  };
}

// POST /api/v1/assessments/:id/resubmit
interface ResubmitRequest {
  correctedData: AssessmentData;
  resubmissionNotes?: string;
}
```

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-organization]:
- AssessmentStatusList: `components/features/assessment/AssessmentStatusList.tsx`
- AssessmentStatusCard: `components/features/assessment/AssessmentStatusCard.tsx`
- FeedbackViewer: `components/features/assessment/FeedbackViewer.tsx`
- ResubmissionDialog: `components/features/assessment/ResubmissionDialog.tsx`
- Follow established component patterns with state management via Zustand

**UI/UX Design Specifications**:
- **Status Badge Colors**: 
  - PENDING: Blue (#3B82F6) with animated pulse
  - VERIFIED: Green (#10B981) solid
  - REJECTED: Red (#EF4444) with warning icon
  - AUTO_VERIFIED: Green (#10B981) with checkmark
- **Layout**: Card-based list with 4-column grid on desktop, single column on mobile
- **Typography**: Assessment titles use font-medium, status badges use font-semibold
- **Interactive States**: Hover effects on cards, focus indicators for accessibility
- **Priority Indicators**: Red dot for urgent attention, yellow for moderate, gray for normal
- **Loading States**: Skeleton cards during data fetching
- **Empty State**: "No assessments found" with illustration and call-to-action
- **Responsive Breakpoints**: md:grid-cols-2 lg:grid-cols-3 xl:grid-cols-4

**Status Integration Pattern** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-organization]:
- Use existing AssessmentCard component patterns for consistency
- Integration with `stores/assessment.store.ts` for assessment state management
- Auto-refresh using established patterns from assessment list components
- Error handling using existing ErrorBoundary component

**Component Interaction Flow**:
```
StatusPage → AssessmentStatusList → [AssessmentStatusCard...]
                ↓
          AssessmentStore ←→ IndexedDB (offline)
                ↓
          API Layer (when online)
                ↓
     AssessmentStatusCard → FeedbackViewer (if rejected)
                ↓
          ResubmissionDialog → ValidationForm → API
```

**Data Flow Architecture**:
1. **Initial Load**: StatusPage → AssessmentStore.fetchAssessments()
2. **Status Filtering**: StatusList → Store.filterByStatus(status)
3. **Feedback Access**: StatusCard → Store.getFeedback(assessmentId)
4. **Resubmission**: Dialog → Store.resubmitAssessment(data) → Queue

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files**:
- Status list component: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/assessment/AssessmentStatusList.tsx`
- Status card component: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/assessment/AssessmentStatusCard.tsx`

- API routes: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/assessments/status/route.ts`
- Feedback API: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/assessments/[id]/feedback/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/assessment/AssessmentStatusList.test.tsx`
- Mock assessment API endpoints and status management
- Test status filtering and display functionality
- Test feedback viewing and resubmission workflows
- Test offline status updates and sync integration

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB status tracking
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

**Status Management Requirements** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- Verification status handling: Support all VerificationStatus enum values
- Feedback system: Rich feedback display with categorization and read status
- Resubmission logic: Preserve assessment history while allowing corrections
- Offline sync: Status updates must sync when connectivity is restored

**Performance Benchmarks**:
- **UI Response Time**: Status list rendering must complete within 2 seconds for up to 200 assessments
- **Memory Usage**: Components should not exceed 30MB heap allocation for 100 status items
- **Load Testing Requirements**:
  - Test status retrieval with 50, 100, and 200+ assessments
  - Measure rendering time and filtering performance at each threshold
  - Test concurrent status updates with multiple users
- **Detailed Load Testing Scenarios**:
  - **Baseline Test**: 10 assessments, target <500ms render time
  - **Standard Load**: 50 assessments with mixed status, target <1s render time
  - **Heavy Load**: 100+ assessments with filtering, target <2s render time
  - **Stress Test**: 200+ assessments with real-time updates, monitor memory usage
  - **Concurrent User Test**: 5 users simultaneously accessing status lists
  - **Network Simulation**: Test under slow 3G conditions (offline-first priority)

**Error Handling Specifications** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- **Status Load Errors**: Display "Unable to load assessment status. Refresh to try again."
- **Feedback Retrieval Errors**: Show "Feedback temporarily unavailable. Check connection."
- **Resubmission Errors**: Provide specific error messages:
  - Validation: "Please address all feedback comments before resubmitting"
  - Network: "Resubmission failed. Will retry when connection is restored"
  - Permission: "You don't have permission to resubmit this assessment"
- **Empty States**: Handle gracefully with appropriate messaging

**Development Guidelines** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- File creation order: API Routes → Components → Integration → Tests
- Component pattern: Hooks first, state second, effects third, handlers fourth, render last
- TypeScript strict mode with explicit types for all status operations
- Error handling with try-catch for all API and resubmission operations

## Testing

   - Test status change notifications and updates
   - Test offline status tracking and sync when connected

5. **Performance Tests**:
   - Test status list performance with 50, 100, and 200+ assessments
   - Measure memory consumption and UI responsiveness
   - Test filtering and search performance with large datasets
   - Verify status operations under offline conditions

6. **Edge Cases**:
