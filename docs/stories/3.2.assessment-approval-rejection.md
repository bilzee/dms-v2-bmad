## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on Story 3.1 completion (Assessment Verification Dashboard):
- AssessmentVerificationQueue component provides the foundation for approval/rejection workflows
- VerificationStatus enum already established (PENDING/VERIFIED/REJECTED)
- Feedback interface already supports assessments with targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'
- Coordinator role patterns and permissions already implemented
- Offline storage patterns established for verification data persistence

### Data Models
**Feedback Interface for Assessment Approval/Rejection** [Source: packages/shared/types/entities.ts:627-642]:
```typescript
// EXISTING Feedback interface - already supports assessments
export interface Feedback {
  id: string;
  targetType: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE';
  targetId: string; // assessmentId when targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  feedbackType: 'REJECTION' | 'CLARIFICATION_REQUEST' | 'APPROVAL_NOTE';
  reason: 'DATA_QUALITY' | 'MISSING_INFO' | 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE' | 'OTHER';
  comments: string;
  priority: 'LOW' | 'NORMAL' | 'HIGH' | 'URGENT';
  requiresResponse: boolean;
  createdAt: Date;
  isRead: boolean;
  isResolved: boolean;
  resolvedAt?: Date;
}
```

**RapidAssessment Interface** [Source: packages/shared/types/entities.ts:40-54]:
```typescript
// EXISTING RapidAssessment interface - no modifications needed
export interface RapidAssessment {
  id: string; // UUID
  type: AssessmentType;
  date: Date;
  affectedEntityId: string;
  assessorName: string;
  assessorId: string;
  verificationStatus: VerificationStatus; // PENDING/VERIFIED/AUTO_VERIFIED/REJECTED
  syncStatus: SyncStatus;
  offlineId?: string;
  data: AssessmentData; // Polymorphic based on type
  mediaAttachments: MediaAttachment[];
  createdAt: Date;
  updatedAt: Date;
}
```

**NEW: Assessment Approval/Rejection Data Structures**:
```typescript
// Assessment Approval Request
export interface AssessmentApprovalRequest {
  assessmentId: string;
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  approvalNote?: string;
  approvalTimestamp: Date;
  notifyAssessor: boolean;
}

// Assessment Rejection Request
export interface AssessmentRejectionRequest {
  assessmentId: string;
  coordinatorId: string;

  rejectionReason: 'DATA_QUALITY' | 'MISSING_INFO' | 'VALIDATION_ERROR' | 'INSUFFICIENT_EVIDENCE' | 'OTHER';
  rejectionComments: string;
  priority: 'LOW' | 'NORMAL' | 'HIGH' | 'URGENT';
  requiresResubmission: boolean;
  notifyAssessor: boolean;
  rejectionTimestamp: Date;
}

// Batch Approval/Rejection Operations
export interface BatchApprovalRequest {
  assessmentIds: string[];
  coordinatorId: string;
  coordinatorName: string;
  batchNote?: string;
  notifyAssessors: boolean;
}

export interface BatchRejectionRequest {
  assessmentIds: string[];

- Assessment rejection: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/verification/AssessmentRejection.tsx`
- Feedback notifications: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/verification/FeedbackNotification.tsx`
- Batch operations: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/verification/BatchApprovalRejection.tsx`

**Integration Files**:

- Batch rejection endpoint: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/verification/assessments/batch-reject/route.ts`

**Store Integration**:
- Extend existing verification store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/verification.store.ts`
- Extend notification store for feedback notifications

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/verification/AssessmentApproval.test.tsx`
- Mock verification API endpoints and notification services
- Test approval workflows and confirmation dialogs
- Test rejection feedback forms and validation
- Test batch operations and progress tracking
- Test notification delivery and offline persistence

### Database/Storage Architecture
**Database Schema** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md]:
- Existing RapidAssessment table with verificationStatus field updates
- Existing Feedback table supports assessments with targetType = 'ASSESSMENT'
- Existing Verification table for audit trail and approval/rejection tracking
- Existing Notification table for feedback delivery to assessors

**Offline Storage Extensions** [Dexie.js Schema]:
```typescript
// EXTEND: packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts
interface OfflineSchema {
  // ... existing tables
  approvalQueue: {
    assessmentId: string;
    action: 'APPROVE' | 'REJECT';
    feedback?: Feedback;
    coordinatorId: string;
    queuedAt: Date;
  };
  feedbackNotifications: {
    feedbackId: string;
    assessorId: string;
    notificationStatus: 'PENDING' | 'SENT' | 'DELIVERED';
    queuedAt: Date;
  };
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB approval action persistence
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Data fetching: SWR or TanStack Query for real-time approval status updates

**Performance Considerations**:
- Optimize approval/rejection actions for quick response times
- Implement efficient batch processing to handle multiple assessments
- Cache approval/rejection states for offline scenarios
- Background processing for notification delivery
- Real-time updates for assessment verification status changes

**Security Considerations**:
- Assessment approval/rejection actions require audit trail for accountability
- Verification actions require proper coordinator role validation
- Cross-reference with role-based access control (Coordinators only)
- Secure handling of batch operations to prevent unauthorized approvals
- Feedback comments may contain sensitive information requiring proper handling

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/verification/AssessmentApproval.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: verification API endpoints, notification services
- Test coverage requirements: approval workflows, rejection feedback, batch operations, notification delivery

**Offline Sync Testing Scenarios**:
- **Offline Approval Queue**: Test approval/rejection actions persist to local approvalQueue when offline
- **Sync Recovery**: Verify queued approval actions sync correctly when connectivity restored
- **Conflict Resolution**: Test handling of approval conflicts (assessment approved offline but rejected by another coordinator online)
- **Partial Sync Failures**: Validate retry mechanisms for failed approval/rejection sync operations
- **Offline Notification Queue**: Test feedback notifications persist locally and deliver when assessor comes online
- **Batch Operation Persistence**: Verify batch approval/rejection operations queue correctly during offline periods
- **Cross-Tab Synchronization**: Test approval actions sync across multiple browser tabs/windows
- **Storage Quota Handling**: Validate graceful degradation when local storage limits reached during offline operations
