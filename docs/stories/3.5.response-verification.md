**Store Integration**:
- Extend verification store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/verification.store.ts` with response verification state
- Add photo verification state management for annotation and quality scoring
- Integrate delivery comparison caching for performance optimization

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/verification/ResponseVerificationInterface.test.tsx`
- Mock verification API endpoints and photo services
- Test delivery metrics validation and variance detection
- Test photo review functionality and annotation capabilities
- Test cross-referencing accuracy between assessments and responses
- Test verification queue filtering and sorting functionality

### Database/Storage Architecture
**Database Schema Extensions** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md]:
- Leverage existing Verification table with responseId foreign key
- Utilize MediaAttachment table for delivery photo storage and metadata
- Extend verification with photo verification metadata and metrics validation results
- Add response verification performance tracking for coordinator analytics

**Offline Storage Extensions**:
```typescript
// EXTEND: packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts
interface OfflineSchema {
  // ... existing tables
  responseVerifications: {
    verificationId: string;
    responseId: string;
    metrics: ResponseVerificationMetrics;
    photoVerifications: PhotoVerificationData[];
    verifierNotes: string;
    queuedAt: Date;
    syncStatus: 'PENDING' | 'SYNCED';
  };
}
```

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling
- Photo handling: Built-in browser File API with canvas for annotation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB verification data persistence

**Performance Considerations**:
- Lazy loading for photo galleries to optimize memory usage
- Progressive image loading with thumbnails for quick preview
- Efficient variance calculation algorithms for large delivery datasets
- Background processing for photo metadata extraction and validation
- Caching of frequently accessed planned vs actual comparisons

**Error Handling and Recovery Mechanisms**:
- **Photo Loading Failures**: 
  - Fallback to cached thumbnails when full photos fail to load
  - Clear error messaging for missing or corrupted delivery photos
  - Graceful degradation when GPS metadata is unavailable
- **Verification API Failures**:
  - Queue verification requests for offline scenarios
  - Preserve verification progress with auto-save functionality
  - Retry logic for failed photo uploads and metadata sync
- **Cross-Reference Validation Errors**:
  - Clear messaging when assessment-response links are broken
  - Alternative verification paths when planned data is unavailable
  - Validation warnings for unusual variance patterns requiring attention
- **Photo Annotation System Errors**:
  - Auto-save annotation progress to prevent data loss
  - Recovery mechanisms for annotation tool crashes
  - Fallback text input when drawing tools are unavailable

**Security Considerations**:
- Photo access controls ensuring only authorized coordinators can view delivery evidence
- Verification audit trails for accountability and compliance tracking
- Secure photo annotation storage preventing tampering with verification evidence
- Protection against photo metadata manipulation or spoofing
- Verification process integrity ensuring coordinators cannot bypass required checks

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/verification/ResponseVerificationInterface.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: verification API endpoints, photo services, GPS metadata
- Test coverage requirements: photo review, metrics validation, cross-referencing, queue management

**Response Verification Testing Scenarios**:
- **Photo Review Testing**: Test photo loading, annotation tools, metadata validation, quality scoring
- **Metrics Validation**: Test planned vs actual comparison, variance detection, beneficiary verification
- **Cross-Referencing**: Test assessment-response linking, data consistency validation, discrepancy flagging
- **Queue Management**: Test filtering, sorting, batch operations, priority handling
- **Performance Testing**:
  - Load 50 photos in gallery: <3 seconds
  - Process metrics validation for 100 responses: <5 seconds
  - Queue loading with 1000+ responses: <2 seconds
  - Photo annotation operations: <500ms response time
- **Offline Verification**: Test verification queue persistence, sync recovery, photo caching
- **Error Recovery**: Test graceful handling of missing photos, API failures, data corruption
