## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on solid foundation from Stories 1.1 and 1.2:
- Assessment forms with offline-first design and GPS capture established
- IndexedDB with Dexie.js operational with encryption and queue management
- Media attachment and validation patterns implemented
- Auto-save functionality and error handling patterns established

### Data Models
**PreliminaryAssessment Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- Extends `RapidAssessment` with `type: AssessmentType.PRELIMINARY` 
- Enhanced data field: `PreliminaryAssessmentData` with impact metrics, severity, population estimates
- Links to auto-created `Incident` via `preliminaryAssessmentIds` array

**PreliminaryAssessmentData Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#supporting-types]:
```typescript
export interface PreliminaryAssessmentData {
  incidentType: IncidentType; // FLOOD, FIRE, LANDSLIDE, CYCLONE, CONFLICT, EPIDEMIC, OTHER
  incidentSubType?: string;
  severity: IncidentSeverity; // MINOR, MODERATE, SEVERE, CATASTROPHIC
  affectedPopulationEstimate: number;
  affectedHouseholdsEstimate: number;
  immediateNeedsDescription: string;
  accessibilityStatus: 'ACCESSIBLE' | 'PARTIALLY_ACCESSIBLE' | 'INACCESSIBLE';
  priorityLevel: 'HIGH' | 'NORMAL' | 'LOW';
  additionalDetails?: string;
}
```

**Incident Auto-Creation** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- `Incident` interface with status: ACTIVE (default for new incidents)
- Links preliminary assessment via `preliminaryAssessmentIds: string[]`
- Automatic population of incident fields from preliminary assessment data

### API Specifications
**Incident Creation Endpoint** [Source: architecture/10-backend-architecture-details.md]:
- POST `/api/v1/incidents/from-assessment` - Creates incident from preliminary assessment
- Automatic incident creation triggered by preliminary assessment submission
- Incident creation queued for offline processing using BullMQ background jobs
- Coordinator notification system for new incident review

**Assessment API Extensions** [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
- Extend existing assessment endpoints to handle PRELIMINARY type
- POST `/api/v1/assessments` with type: 'PRELIMINARY' triggers incident workflow
- Background job processing for incident creation and coordinator notification

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/6-component-architecture.md#frontend-component-organization]:
- PreliminaryAssessmentForm: `components/features/assessment/PreliminaryAssessmentForm.tsx`

- Extend Dexie.js IndexedDB setup for preliminary assessment storage
- Queue incident creation for background processing when online
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive preliminary assessment data
- Priority-based sync with HIGH priority for preliminary assessments

**Development Guidelines** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- File creation order: Extend Types → API Routes → Background Jobs → Components → Integration → Tests
- Component pattern: Hooks first, state second, effects third, handlers fourth, render last
- TypeScript strict mode with explicit types for incident creation workflow
- Error handling with try-catch for all incident creation operations

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/assessment/PreliminaryAssessmentForm.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies: Incident creation API, background job processing
- Test coverage requirements: preliminary assessment form, incident creation workflow, offline storage
- Test preliminary assessment to incident creation end-to-end workflow

**Story-Specific Test Scenarios**:
1. **Incident Auto-Creation Workflow Tests**:
   - Test preliminary assessment submission triggers incident creation API call
   - Verify incident creation with correct data mapping from assessment
   - Test incident creation failure handling and retry logic
   - Verify Coordinator notification triggered after incident creation
   - Test incident linking to preliminary assessment via preliminaryAssessmentIds

2. **Priority Indicator Tests**:
   - Test HIGH priority displays red badge with exclamation icon
   - Test NORMAL priority displays blue badge
   - Test LOW priority displays gray badge with clock icon
   - Verify priority sorting functionality in assessment lists
   - Test priority level selection affects incident priority assignment

3. **Offline Incident Creation Tests**:
   - Test incident creation queued when offline
   - Verify incident creation executes when connectivity restored
   - Test incident creation failure retry mechanism
   - Verify offline incident creation status indicators

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Test incident creation with invalid assessment data
   - Test multiple preliminary assessments creating separate incidents
   - Test incident creation timeout scenarios
   - Verify assessment remains accessible if incident creation fails

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-22

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

**Overall Implementation Quality: PARTIAL COMPLETION**

The development team has created a solid foundation with excellent frontend implementation, comprehensive type safety, and thorough test coverage. However, **critical backend functionality remains incomplete with TODO placeholders** instead of actual implementation.

**Strengths:**
- Comprehensive React component with proper form validation
- Excellent TypeScript integration with Zod schemas
- Well-structured offline-first architecture
- Complete 330-line test suite covering all scenarios
- Proper error handling and loading states
- Visual priority indicators implemented correctly

**Critical Issues:**
- Incident creation API is mock implementation (database save TODO)
- Notification system logs to console only (no real coordinator notification)
- Background job processing not implemented (BullMQ TODO)
- Missing PostgreSQL/Prisma integration as documented

### Refactoring Performed

No refactoring performed due to incomplete backend implementation requiring architectural decisions beyond QA scope.

### Compliance Check

- **Coding Standards**: ✓ TypeScript, React patterns, validation schemas all follow standards
- **Project Structure**: ✓ Files in correct locations per architecture docs  
- **Testing Strategy**: ⚠️ Tests written but Jest not configured, cannot execute
- **All ACs Met**: ✗ AC #3 (incident creation) only partially implemented

### Improvements Checklist

**Immediate Action Required (Backend Implementation):**
- [ ] Implement actual database persistence in incident creation API
- [ ] Integrate PostgreSQL with Prisma ORM as documented
- [ ] Implement real coordinator notification delivery
- [ ] Set up BullMQ background job processing
- [ ] Configure Jest testing framework to enable test execution

**Frontend Minor Issues:**
- [ ] Fix React Hook dependency warnings in ESLint
- [ ] Extract complex useEffect expressions to separate variables
- [ ] Consider using Next.js Image component for better performance

**Testing Infrastructure:**
- [ ] Install and configure Jest for shared package
- [ ] Set up test database for integration testing
- [ ] Add end-to-end tests for complete assessment-to-incident workflow

### Security Review

**Status: CONCERNS**
- Input validation properly implemented with Zod schemas
- No sensitive data exposure in client-side code
- ⚠️ **Coordinator notification system not secured** - mock implementation lacks authentication/authorization
- ⚠️ **Incident creation endpoint has no access control** - accepts any request without user validation

### Performance Considerations

**Status: PASS**
- Offline-first design with IndexedDB storage
- Auto-save functionality prevents data loss
- Proper loading states and error handling
- React Hook Form optimizes re-renders

### Files Modified During Review

None - review only, no code modifications performed.
