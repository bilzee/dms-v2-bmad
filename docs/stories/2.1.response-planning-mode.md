- **GET** `/api/v1/responses/plans` - Retrieve response plans with filtering
- **PUT** `/api/v1/responses/plans/:id` - Update existing response plan
- **GET** `/api/v1/assessments` - Link assessments to response plans

**Request/Response Formats**:
```typescript
// POST /api/v1/responses/plan
interface ResponsePlanRequest {
  responseType: ResponseType;
  affectedEntityId: string;
  assessmentId: string;
  plannedDate: Date;
  data: ResponseData;
  otherItemsDelivered: { item: string; quantity: number; unit: string }[];

- Integration with `stores/response.store.ts` for response state management
- Follow established offline storage patterns
- Error handling using existing ErrorBoundary component

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files**:
- Response planning form: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/ResponsePlanningForm.tsx`
- Item quantity planner: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/ItemQuantityPlanner.tsx`
- Timeline planner: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/DeliveryTimelinePlanner.tsx`
- Entity linker: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/response/EntityAssessmentLinker.tsx`
- Response store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/response.store.ts` (create new)

**Integration Files**:
- Planning page: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/responses/plan/page.tsx`
- API routes: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/responses/plan/route.ts`
- Plans API: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/responses/plans/route.ts`

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/response/ResponsePlanningForm.test.tsx`
- Mock response API endpoints and planning workflows
- Test offline planning creation and storage
- Test item quantity validation and timeline estimation
- Test entity-assessment linking functionality

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB response plan storage
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

**Security Considerations**:
- Response planning contains sensitive logistics data requiring role-based access controls
- Offline response plans stored in IndexedDB must be encrypted for data protection
- GPS location data in planning context requires user consent and secure handling
- Response delivery timelines could expose operational security details - implement field-level access controls
- Cross-reference with existing authentication patterns from Epic 1 for consistent security model

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- Implement ErrorBoundary component for response planning form failures
- Offline storage failure recovery patterns (fallback to memory, user notification)
- Network timeout handling for assessment data fetching
- Validation error messaging for complex item quantity scenarios
- GPS capture failure graceful degradation

**Response Planning Requirements** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- Support all ResponseType enum values (Health, WASH, Shelter, Food, Security, Population)
- Planning status: Default to PLANNED status for new response plans
- Offline creation: Generate offlineId for plans created without connectivity
- Multi-entity support: Single plan can target multiple affected entities

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/response/ResponsePlanningForm.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: response API endpoints, assessment data, entity information
- Test coverage requirements: offline planning, item validation, timeline estimation, entity linking

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-08-23

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Implementation Verification Method
Used Sequential Thinking and Playwright browser automation to validate actual implementation rather than relying solely on documentation.

### Code Quality Assessment

**CRITICAL FINDING**: Major React state management infinite loop bug discovered through live testing.

When clicking response type tabs (e.g., WASH), the application generates hundreds of "Maximum update depth exceeded" console errors, indicating an infinite re-render loop in the ResponsePlanningForm component. This is a P0 production-blocking issue.

**Root Cause Analysis**: 
- The `handleResponseTypeChange` function at line 136-147 in ResponsePlanningForm.tsx triggers multiple setState calls that cause circular updates
- Form validation and auto-save logic interaction creates cascading re-renders
- Zustand store updates combined with React Hook Form updates create update cycle

**Positive Implementation Findings**:
✅ All four main components exist and render correctly
✅ Response type tabs display with proper icons and styling  
✅ Timeline planning interface is comprehensive with date/time inputs
✅ Entity & Assessment linking section renders properly
✅ Item quantity planning section is present
✅ Offline status indicators work correctly
✅ Form layout and UX design matches specifications
✅ Auto-save indicators display correctly

### Refactoring Performed

**NONE** - Due to the severity of the infinite loop bug, no refactoring was safe to perform without potentially masking the underlying issue.

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✗ **React anti-patterns present - infinite re-render loop**
- Project Structure: ✓ **All files in correct locations**
- Testing Strategy: ⚠️ **Tests exist but may not catch this runtime issue**
- All ACs Met: ✗ **AC1 (Response planning form accessible offline) fails due to unusable UI**

### Acceptance Criteria Validation

1. **Response planning form accessible offline**: ❌ **FAILED** - Form crashes with infinite loop
2. **Item/quantity planning interface**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Interface renders but may be unusable due to form issues
3. **Planned delivery timeline estimation**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Timeline renders but form instability affects usability
4. **Link to specific affected entities and assessments**: ⚠️ **PARTIAL** - Components render but interaction blocked by form errors

### Improvements Checklist

**CRITICAL (Must Fix)**:
- [ ] **Fix infinite re-render loop in ResponsePlanningForm.tsx** (Priority: P0)
  - Separate form state updates from component re-renders
  - Implement proper useCallback/useMemo for expensive operations
  - Review auto-save trigger logic for circular dependencies
  - Add React DevTools profiler analysis

**HIGH Priority**:
- [ ] Add error boundary around ResponsePlanningForm to prevent crash
- [ ] Implement proper loading states during form operations
- [ ] Add comprehensive integration tests that catch runtime errors
- [ ] Review Zustand store update patterns for performance

**MEDIUM Priority**:
- [ ] Add form validation error display improvements
- [ ] Implement proper TypeScript strict mode compliance
- [ ] Add accessibility testing for screen readers
- [ ] Performance optimization for large item lists

### Security Review

**No immediate security concerns** identified in the implementation, but the infinite loop could lead to:
- Client-side DoS through excessive CPU usage
- Memory exhaustion in long-running sessions
- Poor user experience that might lead to unsafe workarounds

### Performance Considerations

**CRITICAL PERFORMANCE ISSUE**: The infinite re-render loop will:
- Consume excessive CPU resources
- Drain mobile battery rapidly
- Make the application unusable
- Potentially crash browsers on lower-end devices

### Browser Testing Results

**Test Environment**: Playwright automation on localhost:3002
**Test Scenario**: Navigate to /responses/plan and click WASH tab
**Result**: Immediate console flood with 400+ error messages

### Files Modified During Review

**NONE** - No modifications made due to severity of discovered bug.

### Gate Status

Gate: **FAIL** → docs/qa/gates/2.1-response-planning-mode.yml

**Reason**: Production-blocking infinite loop bug makes core functionality unusable.

### Recommended Status

❌ **Changes Required - Critical Bug Fix Needed**

**Next Steps for Developer**:
1. **IMMEDIATE**: Fix infinite re-render loop in ResponsePlanningForm.tsx
2. Add error boundary to prevent application crash
3. Test all response type tab switching thoroughly
4. Add integration tests that catch runtime React errors
5. Re-submit for QA review after fixes

**Development Notes**:
- The implementation architecture and design are sound
- Components are well-structured and follow established patterns  
- The bug appears to be in state management interaction, not fundamental design
- Once fixed, this story should meet all acceptance criteria
