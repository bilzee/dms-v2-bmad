## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on completed donor management foundation from Story 8.1:
- **Authentication Foundation**: Leverage existing donor authentication and role-based system
- **Commitment System**: Build on existing DonorCommitment model and commitment management
- **API Foundation**: Extend existing donor API endpoints with performance tracking capabilities
- **Dashboard Integration**: Integrate with existing donor dashboard tabs and navigation
- **Database Schema**: Use existing Donor, DonorCommitment, and RapidResponse relationships

### Data Models
**Performance Tracking Models** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md#donor-models]:
```typescript
// Extend existing Donor model with performance calculations
export interface DonorPerformanceMetrics {
  donorId: string;
  onTimeDeliveryRate: number; // Percentage 0-100
  quantityAccuracyRate: number; // Percentage 0-100
  performanceScore: number; // 0-100 calculated score
  totalCommitments: number;
  completedDeliveries: number;
  beneficiariesHelped: number;
  responseTypesServed: ResponseType[];
  lastUpdated: Date;
}

export interface DonorAchievement {
  id: string; // From schema
  donorId: string;
  donor: Donor;
  type: string; // FIRST_DELIVERY, MILESTONE_10, etc.
  title: string;
  description: string;
  earnedAt: Date;
}
```

**Performance Calculation Logic** [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]:
- Link DonorCommitment (status: 'DELIVERED') to RapidResponse (verificationStatus: 'VERIFIED')
- Calculate on-time delivery: (deliveredDate <= targetDate) / total commitments
- Calculate quantity accuracy: (actual quantity / planned quantity) average across commitments
- Performance score: weighted combination of delivery rate, accuracy, and impact metrics

### API Specifications
**Performance Tracking Endpoints** [Source: docs/architecture/5-api-specification.md]:
- GET `/api/v1/donors/performance` - Get donor performance metrics with time period filtering
- GET `/api/v1/donors/performance/history` - Historical performance data for trend analysis
- GET `/api/v1/donors/achievements` - List donor achievements and milestones
- GET `/api/v1/donors/impact` - Impact metrics showing beneficiary outcomes linked to verified responses
- GET `/api/v1/donors/performance/export` - Export performance data as CSV/PDF

**Integration with Response Verification** [Source: docs/architecture/8-database-schema.md]:
- Use existing RapidResponse model with donor attribution (donorId, donorName fields)
- Link verified responses (verificationStatus: 'VERIFIED') to donor performance calculations
- Extract beneficiary data from response.data field for impact metrics

### Component Specifications
**Performance Dashboard Components** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Performance dashboard: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/donor/performance/page.tsx`
- Performance metrics: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/PerformanceMetrics.tsx`
- Performance trends: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/PerformanceTrends.tsx`
- Impact visualization: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/ImpactVisualization.tsx`
- Achievement display: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/AchievementBadges.tsx`

**Integration with Existing Donor Dashboard** [Source: Story 8.1 implementation]:
- Add "Performance" tab to existing donor dashboard alongside "Commitments" and "Profile"
- Extend existing donor.store.ts with performance metrics state management
- Build on established component patterns and TypeScript strict mode compliance

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files** [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Performance page: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/donor/performance/page.tsx`
- Performance components: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/donor/` directory (new files)
- Donor store extension: `packages/frontend/src/stores/donor.store.ts` (extend existing)
- API routes: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/donors/performance/` directory
- Performance hooks: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useDonorPerformance.ts`

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: docs/architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- React 18.3.x: Component architecture with performance visualization components
- Next.js 14.2.x: App Router for performance dashboard and metrics pages
- Zustand 4.5.x: State management extension for performance data
- Recharts 2.12.x: React charting library for performance visualization and trend analysis
- Zod 3.23.x: Schema validation for performance data structures
- Prisma 5.14.x: Database queries for performance metrics aggregation

**Performance Calculation Requirements**:
- Real-time performance score updates when responses are verified
- Efficient aggregation queries for historical data analysis
- Caching strategy for performance metrics to avoid expensive recalculations
- Background job processing for achievement milestone detection

### Security Considerations
**Data Access and Privacy**:
- Performance data accessible only to authenticated donor (own data)
- Impact metrics aggregated without exposing individual beneficiary information
- Achievement data shareable with coordinator consent for recognition programs
- Performance export limited to donor's own data with rate limiting

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: docs/architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- **Test file naming conventions**: 
  - Components: `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/components/features/donor/PerformanceMetrics.test.tsx`
  - Performance hooks: `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/hooks/useDonorPerformance.test.ts`
  - API routes: `packages/frontend/src/__tests__/app/api/v1/donors/performance/route.test.ts`
  - E2E tests: `packages/frontend/src/e2e/__tests__/story-8.2-delivery-performance-tracking.e2e.test.ts`
- **Performance calculation testing**: Mock DonorCommitment and RapidResponse data for metric calculations
- **Achievement system testing**: Test milestone detection and badge awarding logic
- **Dashboard interaction testing**: Test filtering, time period selection, and export functionality
