# Story 1.1: Database Foundation and API Infrastructure

## Status
Done

## Story
**As a** System Administrator,
**I want** optimized database queries and API endpoints for real data access,
**so that** the system can efficiently serve real data to all user roles without performance degradation.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Database indexing optimized for common query patterns across incidents, assessments, responses
2. API endpoints enhanced to serve real data with appropriate role-based filtering
3. Query performance benchmarked and optimized for concurrent access scenarios
4. Caching strategies implemented with Redis for frequently accessed data
5. Database connection pooling configured for production load

## Integration Verification
- **IV1**: All existing API endpoints continue to function without breaking changes
- **IV2**: Database schema remains unchanged and backward compatible
- **IV3**: Performance benchmarks show no degradation in API response times

- **URL Pattern**: `/api/v1/{resource}/{id}/{action}` [Source: architecture/5-api-specification.md#API Design Principles]

### Component Specifications
- **Prisma ORM**: Primary database access layer with type safety [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Redis Caching**: For frequently accessed data and session management [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **BullMQ**: Background job processing for async operations [Source: architecture/10-backend-architecture-details.md]

### File Locations
- **Database Schema**: `prisma/schema.prisma` - existing schema with defined indexes
- **API Routes**: `app/api/v1/` - organized by domain (incidents, assessments, responses)
- **Middleware**: `lib/middleware/` - authentication, rate limiting, logging
- **Database Utils**: `lib/prisma.ts` - Prisma client configuration
- **Caching**: `lib/redis.ts` - Redis client configuration
- **Performance**: `lib/performance/` - monitoring and benchmarking utilities

### Testing Requirements
- **Performance Testing**: Query performance validation with EXPLAIN ANALYZE [Source: docs/qa/test-strategy.md]
- **Integration Testing**: API contract testing with role-based scenarios [Source: docs/qa/test-strategy.md]

### Technical Constraints
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16.x with Prisma ORM 5.14.x [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Caching**: Redis 7.2.x for performance optimization [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]
- **Performance**: <3s API response time requirement [Source: docs/qa/test-strategy.md#Success Metrics Alignment]
- **Concurrency**: Must handle multiple concurrent users across 6 roles [Source: docs/qa/test-strategy.md]
- **No Schema Changes**: Must work with existing database schema [Source: PRD Integration Verification]

## Testing
