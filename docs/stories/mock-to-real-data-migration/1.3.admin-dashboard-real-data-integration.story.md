# Story 1.3: Admin Dashboard Real Data Integration

## Status
Ready for Done

## Story
**As an** Admin User,
**I want** all dashboard elements to display real data from the 3-incident dataset,
**so that** I can make informed system-wide management decisions based on actual operations.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. All admin dashboard charts, statistics, and tables display real incident data
2. User management sections show actual user counts and activity
3. System health indicators reflect real database and API status
4. Resource allocation displays show actual resources from 3 incidents
5. Performance metrics dashboards show real system usage data

## Integration Verification

- **Real Data Endpoints**: Enhanced from Story 1.1 to serve real data with role-based filtering
- **Dashboard Badges API**: `/api/v1/dashboard/badges/{role}` - needs to replace mock data with real queries
- **Performance Monitoring API**: `/api/v1/admin/monitoring/performance` - for real system health data

### Component Specifications
- **Admin Dashboard**: Located at `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/admin/page.tsx`
- **useDashboardBadges Hook**: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useDashboardBadges.ts` - currently using mock data
- **Real-time Updates**: Use SWR configuration from Story 1.2 for live data refresh
- **Loading States**: Enhanced components from Story 1.2 for real data loading
- **Error Boundaries**: Shared error handling components from Story 1.2 foundation
