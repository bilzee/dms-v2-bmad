## Dev Notes

### Technical Architecture
**Building on Story 4.3 Foundation:**
- Extend existing SyncEngine with enhanced detection algorithms
- Enhance ConflictResolver component with advanced UI controls
- Extend existing API endpoints with advanced filtering and operations
- Upgrade IndexedDB schema for advanced metadata and audit requirements

### Data Models Extensions
**Enhanced ConflictDetailed Interface:**
```typescript
export interface ConflictDetailedAdvanced extends ConflictDetailed {
  // Enhanced severity classification with metadata
  severityMetadata: {
    impactScore: number;
    riskLevel: string;
    autoClassification: boolean;
    manualOverride?: string;
  };
  
  // Field-level conflict details
  fieldConflicts: FieldConflict[];
  
  // Advanced resolution metadata
  resolutionComplexity: 'SIMPLE' | 'MODERATE' | 'COMPLEX';
  estimatedResolutionTime: number;
  requiredApprovals: string[];
  
  // Enterprise audit features
  complianceFlags: string[];
  regulatoryRequirements: string[];
}

export interface FieldConflict {
  fieldPath: string;
  fieldName: string;
  localValue: any;
  serverValue: any;
  conflictType: 'VALUE_CHANGE' | 'TYPE_CHANGE' | 'STRUCTURE_CHANGE';
  severity: ConflictSeverity;
  resolutionSuggestion?: 'LOCAL' | 'SERVER' | 'MERGE_REQUIRED';
}
```
