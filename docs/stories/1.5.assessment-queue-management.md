## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on established patterns from Stories 1.1-1.4:
- Offline queue management infrastructure established through previous stories
- IndexedDB with Dexie.js operational with priority-based sync established
- Zustand store patterns for sync management proven effective
- React Hook Form + component patterns established for consistent UI
- Auto-refresh and real-time update patterns from assessment forms

### Data Models
**OfflineQueueItem Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#offline-queue-management]:
```typescript
export interface OfflineQueueItem {
  id: string; // Local UUID
  type: 'ASSESSMENT' | 'RESPONSE' | 'MEDIA' | 'ENTITY';
  action: 'CREATE' | 'UPDATE' | 'DELETE';
  entityId?: string; // Server ID if updating
  data: any; // The actual data to sync
  retryCount: number;
  priority: 'HIGH' | 'NORMAL' | 'LOW';
  createdAt: Date;
  lastAttempt?: Date;
  error?: string;
}
```

**SyncStatus Enum** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
```typescript
export enum SyncStatus {
  PENDING = 'PENDING',
  SYNCING = 'SYNCING', 
  SYNCED = 'SYNCED',
  CONFLICT = 'CONFLICT',
  FAILED = 'FAILED'
}
```

**Priority Management** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- Health assessments automatically assigned HIGH priority
- Assessment creation HIGH priority due to coordinator dependencies
- Media attachments NORMAL priority for bandwidth management
- Entity updates NORMAL priority unless linked to health assessments

### Architecture Implementation
**Client-Side IndexedDB Architecture** [Updated Implementation]:
This implementation uses a fully client-side approach with IndexedDB for offline-first functionality:

- **Database Layer**: IndexedDB with Dexie.js for local queue storage and management
- **Service Layer**: `OfflineQueueService` handles all queue operations locally
- **Sync Operations**: Real-time sync to backend APIs when network is available
- **API Endpoints**: Return 410 Gone status, indicating client-side only implementation

**Queue Management Operations** [Source: lib/services/OfflineQueueService.ts]:
- `getQueueItems(filters)` - Retrieve and filter queue items from IndexedDB
- `retryQueueItem(id)` - Manual retry for failed sync items with exponential backoff
- `getQueueSummary()` - Queue statistics for dashboard widget
- `removeQueueItem(id)` - Remove synced or cancelled queue items

**Queue Filtering Parameters**:
- `status`: PENDING, SYNCING, FAILED, SYNCED
- `priority`: HIGH, NORMAL, LOW  
- `type`: ASSESSMENT, RESPONSE, MEDIA, ENTITY
- Client-side filtering for immediate response without network calls

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-organization]:
- AssessmentQueue: `components/features/sync/AssessmentQueue.tsx`
- QueueItem: `components/features/sync/QueueItem.tsx`
- QueueSummary: `components/features/sync/QueueSummary.tsx` (for dashboard widget)
- Follow established component patterns with state management via Zustand

**Sync Integration Pattern** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md#frontend-organization]:
- Use existing SyncIndicator and OfflineQueue components for consistency
- Integration with `stores/sync.store.ts` for queue state management
- Auto-refresh using established patterns from assessment list components
- Error handling using existing ErrorBoundary component

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files** [Updated Implementation]:
- Queue component: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/sync/AssessmentQueue.tsx`
- Queue service: `packages/frontend/src/lib/services/OfflineQueueService.ts`
- Sample data service: `packages/frontend/src/lib/services/SampleDataService.ts`
- Offline database: `packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts` (IndexedDB with Dexie.js)
- Sync store: `packages/frontend/src/stores/sync.store.ts`

**Integration Files** [Updated Implementation]:
- Dashboard integration: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/page.tsx` (queue summary widget)
- Queue page: `packages/frontend/src/app/(dashboard)/queue/page.tsx`
- API stubs: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/queue/route.ts` (returns 410 Gone)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/sync/AssessmentQueue.test.tsx`
- Mock sync operations and queue state management
- Test priority-based sorting and filtering functionality
- Test retry mechanisms with different failure scenarios
- Test real-time queue updates and status changes

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for queue state
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB queue storage
- Queue: BullMQ 5.7.x for background job processing (server-side)
- Real-time: Consider WebSocket or polling for queue status updates

**Queue Requirements** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#offline-queue-management]:
- Priority handling: Health assessments take precedence in queue processing
- Retry logic: Exponential backoff starting at 5 seconds, max 10 retries
- Conflict resolution: Manual resolution for CONFLICT status items
- Error handling: Clear error messages for different failure types

**Performance Benchmarks & Load Testing Criteria**:
- **UI Response Time**: Queue rendering must complete within 2 seconds for up to 500 items
- **Memory Usage**: Component should not exceed 50MB heap allocation for 1000 queue items
- **Pagination**: Implement virtual scrolling for queues exceeding 100 items
- **Load Testing Requirements**:
  - Test queue performance with 100, 500, and 1000+ items
  - Measure rendering time and memory consumption at each threshold
  - Verify smooth scrolling and filtering operations under load
  - Test concurrent queue updates with multiple users (10+ simultaneous)
- **Network Performance**: Queue sync operations must handle 3G connectivity (250ms latency)
- **Battery Impact**: Queue auto-refresh should not exceed 5% battery drain per hour on mobile

**Error Handling Specifications** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- **Network Errors**: Display "Unable to connect. Operating in offline mode." with retry option
- **Sync Failures**: Show specific error messages based on failure type:
  - Authentication: "Session expired. Please log in again."
  - Server Error: "Sync failed due to server issue. Will retry automatically."
  - Validation Error: "Data validation failed: [specific field errors]"
  - Conflict Error: "Data conflict detected. Manual resolution required."
- **Queue Operation Errors**: Handle with user-friendly messages:
  - Queue Load Failure: "Unable to load queue. Refresh to try again."
  - Retry Failure: "Retry failed. Item moved to failed status."
  - Empty Queue: "No pending items. All assessments are up to date."
- **Performance Degradation**: Show loading states and pagination for large queues
- **Error Recovery**: Implement exponential backoff with clear status indicators

**Development Guidelines** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- File creation order: API Routes → Components → Integration → Tests
- Component pattern: Hooks first, state second, effects third, handlers fourth, render last
- TypeScript strict mode with explicit types for all queue operations
- Error handling with try-catch for all queue and retry operations

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/sync/AssessmentQueue.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
