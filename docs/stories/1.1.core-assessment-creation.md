### Previous Story Insights
No previous stories exist - this is the first story in the project.

### Data Models
**Assessment Entity Structure** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- `RapidAssessment` interface with fields: id (UUID), type, date, affectedEntityId, assessorName, assessorId, verificationStatus, syncStatus, offlineId, data (polymorphic), mediaAttachments, createdAt, updatedAt
- `AssessmentType` enum: HEALTH, WASH, SHELTER, FOOD, SECURITY, POPULATION
- `VerificationStatus` enum: PENDING, VERIFIED, AUTO_VERIFIED, REJECTED
- `SyncStatus` enum: PENDING, SYNCING, SYNCED, CONFLICT, FAILED

**Assessment Data Types** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#polymorphic-assessment-data-types]:
- `HealthAssessmentData`: hasFunctionalClinic, numberHealthFacilities, qualifiedHealthWorkers, commonHealthIssues[], etc.
- `WashAssessmentData`: isWaterSufficient, waterSource[], waterQuality, hasToilets, numberToilets, etc.
- `ShelterAssessmentData`: areSheltersSufficient, shelterTypes[], shelterCondition, needsRepair, etc.
- `FoodAssessmentData`: foodSource[], availableFoodDurationDays, malnutritionCases, etc.
- `SecurityAssessmentData`: isAreaSecure, securityThreats[], hasSecurityPresence, etc.

**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/6-component-architecture.md#frontend-component-organization]:
- Components location: `components/features/assessment/`
- Required components: AssessmentForm.tsx, AssessmentList.tsx, AssessmentCard.tsx
- Follow strict component pattern with FC interface, explicit props, error handling
- Use Shadcn/ui components for UI elements

**Form Component Pattern** [Source: architecture/6-component-architecture.md#component-template-pattern]:
- Use React Hook Form with Zod resolver for validation
- Include offline state management with useOfflineStore
- Implement auto-save draft functionality every 30 seconds

**Development Guidelines** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- File creation order: Types → Stores → Hooks → Components → Pages → Tests
- Component pattern: Hooks first, state second, effects third, handlers fourth, render last
- TypeScript strict mode with explicit types for all function parameters
- Error handling with try-catch for all async operations

### Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/assessment/AssessmentForm.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies: stores, hooks, API calls

#### Review Summary
Comprehensive code review conducted of the core assessment creation implementation. The story implements a solid foundation with proper TypeScript interfaces, Zod validation, GPS capture functionality, and offline storage using Dexie.js. However, critical gaps prevent meeting acceptance criteria.

#### Key Findings

**Implementation Strengths:**
- ✅ Proper TypeScript interfaces for assessment entities
- ✅ Comprehensive Zod validation schemas for all assessment types  
- ✅ Robust GPS capture hook with error handling and accuracy detection
- ✅ IndexedDB configuration with queue management and draft auto-save
- ✅ Component architecture follows established patterns

**Critical Issues:**
- ❌ **AC1 Incomplete**: Only HEALTH and POPULATION assessment types implemented (2/6), missing WASH, SHELTER, FOOD, SECURITY
- ❌ **Security Gap**: Encryption implementation is placeholder-level (base64) instead of required AES-256
- ❌ **Test Coverage**: Missing P0 critical tests for offline functionality, data integrity, and sync reliability

**Testing Analysis:**
- Basic component rendering tests present
- Missing offline scenario testing (isOnline: false)
- No GPS capture validation testing
- No IndexedDB persistence testing
- No encryption/decryption testing

#### Acceptance Criteria Assessment
1. **All 6 assessment types available offline**: ❌ FAIL - Only 2/6 implemented
2. **Form validation works without connectivity**: ✅ PASS - Zod validation works offline
3. **GPS coordinates captured automatically with timestamp**: ✅ PASS - Proper implementation
4. **Assessment saved locally with IndexedDB persistence**: ✅ PASS - Database setup complete

#### Recommendations
1. **Priority 1**: Complete implementation of missing assessment types (WASH, SHELTER, FOOD, SECURITY)
2. **Priority 1**: Implement proper AES-256 encryption for sensitive data
3. **Priority 2**: Add comprehensive test coverage for offline functionality and data integrity
4. **Priority 3**: Validate performance requirements (<3s load time, <1s offline access)
