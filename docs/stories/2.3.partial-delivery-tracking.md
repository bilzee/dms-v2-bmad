### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/features/response/PartialDeliveryTracker.test.tsx`
- Mock partial delivery API endpoints and tracking calculations
- Test percentage completion calculations and remaining quantity logic
- Test reason code selection and validation
- Test follow-up task generation and assignment
- Test offline partial delivery tracking and storage
- Test integration with existing response conversion workflow

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state management
- Forms: React Hook Form 7.51.x with Zod 3.23.x for validation
- Offline: Dexie.js 4.0.x for IndexedDB partial delivery storage
- UI: Shadcn/ui components with Tailwind CSS for consistent styling

**Security Considerations**:
- Partial delivery data contains operational details requiring role-based access controls
- Follow-up task assignments require proper user permission validation
- Reason codes and delivery metrics require audit trail for accountability
- Cross-reference with existing authentication patterns from Epic 1 and Stories 2.1/2.2

**Error Handling Requirements**:
- Implement ErrorBoundary component for partial delivery form failures
- Offline storage failure recovery patterns for tracking data
- Network timeout handling for partial delivery API calls
- Validation error messaging for completion percentage calculations
- Follow-up task creation failure handling with retry mechanisms

**Partial Delivery Requirements**:
- Support IN_PROGRESS status for responses with partial deliveries
- Maintain planned vs delivered vs remaining quantity tracking
- Generate follow-up tasks automatically based on completion thresholds
- Support multiple partial deliveries per response with cumulative tracking
- Preserve all partial delivery history for audit purposes
- Ensure partial delivery data cannot be lost during offline operations

**Performance Considerations**:
- Optimize percentage calculations for real-time updates during data entry
- Minimize form re-renders during quantity tracking updates
- Efficient storage of partial delivery data for offline scenarios
- Background processing for follow-up task generation and notifications

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/features/response/PartialDeliveryTracker.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library for component testing
- Mock external dependencies: partial delivery API endpoints, calculation logic, follow-up systems
- Test coverage requirements: percentage calculations, reason code validation, follow-up generation, offline tracking
