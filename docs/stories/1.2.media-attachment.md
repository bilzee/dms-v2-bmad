## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Building on Story 1.1's solid foundation:
- IndexedDB with Dexie.js is established and working with encryption
- GPS capture functionality (useGPS hook) is implemented and reliable
- Offline queue management system is operational
- Assessment forms have auto-save and validation patterns established

### Data Models
**MediaAttachment Interface** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#supporting-types]:
- `MediaAttachment` interface with fields: id, url (S3 when synced), localPath (device path), thumbnailUrl, mimeType, size, metadata
- `metadata` includes: gpsCoordinates (latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp), timestamp, captureMethod
- `GPSCoordinates` interface: latitude, longitude, accuracy, timestamp, captureMethod ('GPS' | 'MANUAL' | 'MAP_SELECT')

**Extended Assessment Model** [Source: architecture/4-data-models.md#core-entity-interfaces]:
- `RapidAssessment.mediaAttachments: MediaAttachment[]` - array of attached media
- Integration with existing verification and sync status workflows

### API Specifications
**File Upload Strategy** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#backend-stack]:
- File Storage: AWS S3 / Local for media storage
- Progressive upload support for large files
- Multipart upload for reliability in poor connectivity

### Component Specifications
**Component Architecture** [Source: architecture/6-component-architecture.md#frontend-component-organization]:
- Media components location: `components/shared/MediaUpload.tsx`
- Follow established component pattern with FC interface, explicit props, error handling
- Integration with existing AssessmentForm component pattern

**Media Component Pattern** [Source: architecture/6-component-architecture.md#component-template-pattern]:
- Use React Hook Form integration for form context
- Include offline state management with useOfflineStore
- Implement camera access using WebRTC getUserMedia API
- Handle file compression and thumbnail generation client-side

### File Locations
**Primary Implementation Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Media upload component: `packages/frontend/src/components/shared/MediaUpload.tsx`
- Media hook: `packages/frontend/src/hooks/useMediaUpload.ts`
- Extended offline database: `packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/db.ts` (add media table)
- Media sync service: `packages/frontend/src/lib/offline/sync.ts` (extend sync)

**Integration Files** [Source: architecture/source-tree.md]:
- Assessment form: `packages/frontend/src/components/features/assessment/AssessmentForm.tsx` (extend)
- Assessment types: `packages/shared/types/entities.ts` (already defined)
- Validation schemas: `packages/shared/utils/validation.ts` (extend)

### Testing Requirements
**Testing Strategy** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file pattern: `__tests__/components/shared/MediaUpload.test.tsx`
- Mock camera API: `jest.mock('getUserMedia')`
- Test offline storage: Mock IndexedDB operations with Dexie
- Test file compression and GPS integration
- Test patterns: render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor from @testing-library/react

### Technical Constraints
**Technology Stack** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md]:
- Frontend: Next.js 14.2.x, React 18.3.x, Zustand 4.5.x for state
- File handling: Browser File API, Canvas API for compression
- Offline: Extend Dexie.js 4.0.x IndexedDB setup for blob storage
- GPS: Existing useGPS hook integration with accuracy detection

**Performance Requirements** [Source: architecture/2-tech-stack.md#infrastructure-devops]:
- Image compression: Maintain quality while reducing file size for upload
- Thumbnail generation: 150x150px previews for list views
- Storage optimization: Clean up old media files and failed uploads
- Battery optimization: Minimize camera usage impact on device battery

**Security Requirements** [Source: architecture/9-frontend-architecture-details.md#offline-database-setup]:
- AES-256 encryption for sensitive media using existing Web Crypto API setup
- Secure blob storage in IndexedDB with device-specific key
- Privacy protection: Camera permission management and user consent

**Development Guidelines** [Source: architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]:
- File creation order: Extend Types → Extend Stores → Media Hook → Media Component → Form Integration → Tests
- Component pattern: Hooks first, state second, effects third, handlers fourth, render last
- TypeScript strict mode with explicit types for file operations and media metadata
- Error handling with try-catch for all file operations and camera access

## Testing
**Testing Standards** [Source: architecture/14-testing-strategy.md]:
- Test file location: `__tests__/components/shared/MediaUpload.test.tsx`
- Testing framework: Jest with React Testing Library
- Mock external dependencies: Camera API, file operations, GPS capture
- Test coverage requirements: file capture, compression, offline storage, sync indicators
- Test media upload workflow with offline queue functionality
