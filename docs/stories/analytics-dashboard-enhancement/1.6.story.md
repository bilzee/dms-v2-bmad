# Story 1.6: Real-time Data Synchronization

## Status
Ready for Review

## Story

**As a** Coordinator,  
**I want** dashboard data to automatically refresh when new assessments, responses, or incidents are recorded,  
**so that** I maintain current situational awareness without manual refresh actions.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Dashboard subscribes to real-time data updates using existing patterns
2. Charts, maps, and summary components update automatically with new data
3. Update indicators show when fresh data is loaded
4. Graceful handling of temporary connectivity loss with retry logic
5. Update frequency balances real-time needs with performance considerations

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Real-time updates don't interfere with existing notification and sync systems
- **IV2**: Data update patterns maintain consistency with existing PWA offline strategies
- **IV3**: Update frequency and resource usage remain within acceptable system limits

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Previous Story 1.5 successfully implemented Interactive Map Integration with React-Map-GL migration from React-Leaflet due to Next.js 14 compatibility issues. The analytics store integration and cross-panel communication patterns are established and working well. Real-time synchronization will build upon this solid foundation of state management and component communication.

### Data Models

**Real-time Update Data Structure** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-design]:
- Real-time updates integrate with existing 25-second refresh intervals from monitoring.store.ts
- Update notifications include data type, affected entities, and change timestamps
- Connection status managed through analytics.store.ts with automatic reconnection

**Update Notification Response** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-endpoints]:
```json
{
  "type": "data_update",
  "timestamp": "2025-09-16T12:00:00Z",
  "changes": {
    "incidents": ["incident-1"],
    "assessments": ["assessment-1", "assessment-2"],
    "responses": ["response-1"]
  },
  "affectedEntities": ["entity-1", "entity-2"]
}
```

### API Specifications

**Real-time Connection Management** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-integration]:
- **Connection Type**: Server-Sent Events (SSE) or WebSocket connection to `/api/v1/monitoring/analytics/realtime`
- **Fallback Strategy**: Polling every 25 seconds when real-time connection unavailable
- **Integration**: Extends existing monitoring API patterns without modifications

**Update Endpoints** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-endpoints]:
- **GET /api/v1/monitoring/analytics/updates/since/{timestamp}**: Fetch updates since last sync
- **POST /api/v1/monitoring/analytics/subscribe**: Subscribe to real-time updates for specific data types
- **Authentication**: Inherits existing NextAuth.js session validation automatically

### Component Specifications

**Real-time Update Integration** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#component-architecture]:
- **UpdateIndicator Component**: Shows connection status and last update time across all panels
- **Analytics Store Enhancement**: Add real-time subscription management to existing analytics.store.ts
- **Cross-Panel Coordination**: Real-time updates trigger coordinated refresh across LeftPanel, CenterPanel, RightPanel, and InteractiveMap

**Performance Optimization** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#performance-optimization]:
- Debounced updates prevent UI thrashing during rapid data changes
- Selective component re-rendering using React.memo and useCallback patterns
- Intelligent caching to minimize redundant API calls

## QA Results

### Review Date: 2025-09-16

### Reviewed By: Quinn (Test Architect)

### Code Quality Assessment

The Story 1.6 implementation demonstrates excellent real-time architecture with comprehensive Server-Sent Events (SSE) integration. The implementation includes robust connection management, proper error handling with exponential backoff retry logic, and intelligent fallback to polling when real-time connections fail. The code follows React patterns well with proper use of Zustand for state management and includes comprehensive test coverage.

### Refactoring Performed

- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/app/api/v1/monitoring/analytics/realtime/route.ts`
  - **Change**: Removed broadcastUpdate function export and delegated to separate utility
  - **Why**: Next.js API routes should only export standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.), not custom functions
  - **How**: Improves code architecture by separating concerns and following Next.js best practices

- **File**: `packages/frontend/src/lib/realtime/broadcast.ts` (New)
  - **Change**: Created dedicated utility for real-time broadcast functionality
  - **Why**: Better separation of concerns and reusability
  - **How**: Centralizes connection management and broadcast logic in a dedicated module

- **File**: `packages/frontend/tests/stores/analytics.realtime.test.ts`
  - **Change**: Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in EventSource mocking
  - **Why**: Ensure tests compile and run correctly
  - **How**: Improved type casting for Jest mocks to match TypeScript expectations

### Compliance Check

- Coding Standards: ✓ Follows React functional components, proper useEffect cleanup, and Next.js patterns
- Project Structure: ✓ Components properly organized under analytics feature directory
- Testing Strategy: ✓ Comprehensive unit tests with proper mocking of WebSocket/SSE connections
- All ACs Met: ✓ All acceptance criteria implemented with proper real-time synchronization

### Improvements Checklist

- [x] Refactored API route to follow Next.js best practices (separated broadcastUpdate utility)
- [x] Fixed TypeScript compilation errors in test files
- [x] Validated real-time connection lifecycle management
- [x] Confirmed proper integration with existing analytics store patterns
- [ ] Consider adding integration tests for cross-panel update coordination

### Security Review

No security concerns identified. Authentication is properly handled through NextAuth.js session validation. Real-time endpoint correctly validates user sessions before establishing connections. No sensitive data exposed in SSE messages.

### Performance Considerations

Implementation includes excellent performance optimizations:
- 300ms debouncing prevents UI thrashing during rapid updates  
- Intelligent fallback to 25-second polling maintains consistency with existing patterns
- Exponential backoff retry logic (max 30s) prevents excessive reconnection attempts
- Proper cleanup of event listeners and timers prevents memory leaks
