# Story 1.4: Right Panel - Entity Gaps Summary and Quick Statistics

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** Coordinator,  
**I want** to view Entity Gaps Summary and Quick Statistics with color-coded assessment area indicators,  
**so that** I can quickly assess overall situation severity and entity-specific conditions at a glance.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. **Entity Gaps Summary section** displays affected entities (based on selected incident) with color-coded icons for each assessment area (Health, WASH, Food, Shelter, Security)
2. **Quick Statistics section** shows overall incident statistics with assessment area icons color-coded by severity (red/yellow/green)
3. Color coding indicates gap severity: Red (critical gaps), Yellow (moderate gaps), Green (minimal/no gaps)
4. Both sections update dynamically based on incident selection from left panel
5. Visual hierarchy optimized for quick scanning and situational awareness
6. Icons/indicators maintain readability within right panel space constraints

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Gap severity calculations align with existing assessment-to-response comparison logic
- **IV2**: Entity gap analysis uses established assessment data structures
- **IV3**: Color-coding system remains consistent with existing DMS severity indicators
