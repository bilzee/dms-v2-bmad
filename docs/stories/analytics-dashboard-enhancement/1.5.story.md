# Story 1.5: Interactive Map Integration

## Status
Done

## Story

**As a** Coordinator,  
**I want** an interactive map at the bottom of the center panel showing all affected entities with highlighting for selected entities,  
**so that** I can visualize geographic context of assessments, responses, and coverage gaps.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Map displays at bottom of center panel without requiring panel scrolling
2. All affected entities shown as map markers/layers regardless of selection
3. Selected entity (or all entities) highlighted with distinct visual treatment
4. Map updates highlighting based on center panel entity selection
5. Map shows assessment locations, response coverage, and gap analysis overlays
6. Map integration maintains existing geographic data patterns

### Integration Verification
- **IV1**: Map functionality doesn't interfere with existing geographic features in DMS
- **IV2**: Geographic data APIs continue serving existing mapping needs uninterrupted
- **IV3**: Map rendering performance doesn't impact overall dashboard responsiveness

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
Previous Story 1.4 successfully implemented Entity Gaps Summary and Quick Statistics with color-coded severity indicators. The analytics store integration and cross-panel communication patterns are established and working well. The right panel components demonstrate effective use of dynamic updates based on incident selection from the left panel.

### Data Models

**Geographic Entity Data Structure** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-design]:
- Entity coordinates from existing geographic data APIs
- Entity selection state managed through analytics.store.ts 
- Map highlighting coordinated with center panel dropdown selection

**Map Marker Data Response** [Source: architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-endpoints]:
```json
{
  "entities": [
    {
      "id": "entity-1",
      "name": "Maiduguri Metropolitan",
      "type": "LGA",
      "coordinates": [11.8311, 13.1511]
    }
  ]
}
```
