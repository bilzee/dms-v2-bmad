# Story 1.1: Foundation Layout

## Parent Epic
**Epic 1: Analytics Dashboard Enhancement** - Story 1.1: Foundation Dashboard Layout [Source: docs/prd/analytics-dashboard-enhancement.md#story-11-foundation-dashboard-layout]

## Status
Approved

## Story
**As a** Coordinator,
**I want** a responsive 3-panel dashboard layout optimized for full-screen monitors,
**so that** I can view all analytical information simultaneously without scrolling in the monitoring room.

## Acceptance Criteria
1. Dashboard renders in 3-panel layout (left, center, right) optimized for 1920x1080+ displays
2. All panels are fully visible without vertical scrolling
3. Layout maintains existing DMS UI consistency and shadcn/ui component patterns
4. Navigation integration works with existing routing and authentication
5. Responsive behavior maintained for tablet/mobile fallback access

## Tasks / Subtasks

- [ ] **Task 1: Create Main Analytics Dashboard Page** (AC: 1, 4)
  - [ ] Create `/app/(dashboard)/analytics-dashboard/page.tsx` as Client Component
  - [ ] Implement 3-panel grid layout using Tailwind CSS Grid
  - [ ] Add Next.js App Router navigation integration
  - [ ] Ensure authentication middleware protection

- [ ] **Task 2: Implement Panel Structure Components** (AC: 1, 2, 3)
  - [ ] Create `AnalyticsDashboard.tsx` main component in `/components/features/analytics/`
  - [ ] Create placeholder `LeftPanel.tsx`, `CenterPanel.tsx`, `RightPanel.tsx` components
  - [ ] Apply shadcn/ui Card components for panel structure
  - [ ] Implement full-screen optimized layout (no vertical scroll for 1920x1080+)

- [ ] **Task 3: Responsive Design Implementation** (AC: 5)
  - [ ] Add responsive breakpoints for tablet/mobile fallback
  - [ ] Test layout on different screen sizes
  - [ ] Ensure usability on minimum supported viewport

- [ ] **Task 4: Integration Verification Testing** (AC: 4)
  - [ ] Verify existing DMS navigation remains functional
  - [ ] Test authentication middleware integration
  - [ ] Confirm no performance degradation in existing monitoring dashboard

## Dev Notes

### Previous Story Insights
No previous analytics dashboard stories - this is the foundation story for the new analytics enhancement.

### Architecture Context
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#component-architecture]

**Technology Stack:**
- Next.js 14.2.x App Router with Client Components for interactivity
- React 18.3.x functional components with hooks
- Tailwind CSS 3.4.x for responsive grid layout
- shadcn/ui component library for consistent UI patterns
- Zustand 4.5.x for future state management (not needed in this foundation story)

**Component Architecture:**
- **AnalyticsDashboard**: Main dashboard container managing 3-panel layout
- **Integration Points**: App Router page at `/analytics-dashboard`, existing dashboard layout and authentication
- **Dependencies**: DashboardLayout, authentication middleware, shadcn/ui providers

### File Locations
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#source-tree-integration]

**New Files to Create:**
```
packages/frontend/src/
├── app/(dashboard)/analytics-dashboard/page.tsx     # Main route page
├── components/features/analytics/
│   ├── AnalyticsDashboard.tsx                       # Main dashboard component
│   ├── LeftPanel.tsx                                # Left panel placeholder
│   ├── CenterPanel.tsx                              # Center panel placeholder
│   └── RightPanel.tsx                               # Right panel placeholder
```

**Import Patterns:**
- Use absolute imports with `@/` prefix: `@/components/features/analytics/AnalyticsDashboard`
- Follow existing barrel export patterns
- Import shadcn/ui components: `@/components/ui/card`

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#coding-standards-and-conventions]

**Performance Requirements:**
- Dashboard bundle size capped at 150KB gzipped
- Full-screen optimization for 1920x1080+ displays
- No vertical scrolling requirement
- Maintain existing page load performance

**Integration Rules:**
- Use established Next.js 14 App Router patterns with `(dashboard)` route group
- Follow existing Client Component patterns with `'use client'` directive
- Maintain shadcn/ui component consistency
- Integrate with existing authentication middleware automatically

**File Naming Conventions:**
- Routes: kebab-case (`analytics-dashboard`)
- React Components: PascalCase (`AnalyticsDashboard.tsx`)
- Follow existing feature-based organization under `/components/features/analytics/`

### Data Models
No specific data models required for this foundation layout story. Data integration will be handled in subsequent panel implementation stories.

### API Specifications
No API integration required for this foundation story. API endpoints will be implemented in subsequent stories.

### Testing
**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library [Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#coding-standards-and-conventions]

**Test Requirements:**
- Component rendering tests for AnalyticsDashboard and panel components
- Responsive layout testing for different viewport sizes
- Navigation integration testing
- Authentication middleware integration testing
