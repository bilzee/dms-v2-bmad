**Files to Modify:**
```
packages/frontend/src/components/features/analytics/
├── LeftPanel.tsx                                # Enhanced from placeholder
├── PopulationImpactSummary.tsx                  # New component
├── IncidentTimeline.tsx                         # New component
└── __tests__/
    ├── LeftPanel.test.tsx                       # Enhanced tests
    ├── PopulationImpactSummary.test.tsx         # New tests  
    └── IncidentTimeline.test.tsx                # New tests
```

**New Files to Create:**
```
packages/frontend/src/
├── stores/analytics.store.ts                    # New Zustand store
└── app/api/v1/monitoring/analytics/
    └── incidents/[id]/summary/route.ts          # New API endpoint
```

### Technical Constraints
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]

**API Integration Rules:**
- Must use existing `/api/v1/incidents` for incident list
- New analytics endpoint must aggregate existing data without schema changes
- Follow established API response patterns and error handling

**Performance Requirements:**
- Incident selection must update cross-panel state efficiently
- Summary data loading should not block UI interaction
- Maintain existing 25-second refresh patterns for real-time updates

**State Management Pattern:**
```typescript
// analytics.store.ts structure
interface AnalyticsState {
  selectedIncident: Incident | null;
  incidentSummary: IncidentSummary | null;
  setSelectedIncident: (incident: Incident) => void;
  fetchIncidentSummary: (incidentId: string) => Promise<void>;
}
```

### Data Models
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#api-design-and-integration]

**API Response Structure:**
```typescript
interface IncidentSummary {
  incident: {
    id: string;
    title: string;
    status: "ACTIVE" | "CONTAINED" | "RESOLVED";
    declarationDate: string;
    currentDate: string;
    duration: {
      days: number;
      hours: number;
      formatted: string;
    };
  };
  populationImpact: {
    livesLost: number;
    injured: number;
    displaced: number;
    housesAffected: number;
  };
  aggregates: {
    affectedEntities: number;
    totalAffectedPopulation: number;
    totalAffectedHouseholds: number;
  };
}
```

### API Specifications
**New Endpoint:** `GET /api/v1/monitoring/analytics/incidents/{id}/summary`

**Integration Requirements:**
- Consume existing incident, assessment, and population data
- Calculate duration from declaration date to current time
- Aggregate population impact across all related assessments
- Return structured summary data for left panel display

### Security Considerations
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#infrastructure-and-deployment-integration]

**Authentication & Authorization:**
- Analytics dashboard inherits existing NextAuth.js middleware protection
- Left panel incident selection respects user session-based authentication
- No additional role-based filtering required per PRD requirements (accessible to all system users)

**Data Security:**
- API endpoints follow established authentication patterns
- Incident and population data accessed through existing secure API layer
- No sensitive data exposure in client-side state management

### Testing
[Source: docs/architecture/analytics-dashboard-enhancement-architecture.md#coding-standards-and-conventions]

**Test Framework:** Jest with React Testing Library + Playwright for E2E
