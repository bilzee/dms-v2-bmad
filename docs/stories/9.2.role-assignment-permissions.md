## Dev Notes

### Architecture Context

**Previous Story Insights**: From Story 9.1, the following foundational elements are established:
- User management API endpoints and authentication system
- Admin middleware and role-based access control patterns
- UserManagement page structure at `/admin/users`
- Audit logging infrastructure for user management actions

**Data Models**: Role management builds on existing User and UserRole models [Source: docs/architecture/4-data-models.md]
- User interface includes: id, email, name, phone?, organization?, roles[], activeRole, permissions[], lastSync?, createdAt, updatedAt
- UserRole interface: id, name (ASSESSOR|RESPONDER|COORDINATOR|DONOR|ADMIN), permissions[], isActive
- Permission system already defined for role-based access control
- Need to extend with RolePermission junction table and RoleHistory for audit trail

**API Specifications**: Building on existing admin API patterns [Source: Story 9.1 implementation]
- Follow `/api/v1/admin/` route structure established in Story 9.1
- Use consistent authentication middleware and error handling patterns
- Implement Zod validation schemas for role assignment requests
- Maintain compatibility with existing user management endpoints

**Component Specifications**: Role management components follow established patterns [Source: docs/architecture/13-development-guidelines-for-llm-driven-development.md]
- Use TypeScript exclusively with explicit types
- Follow component implementation pattern: hooks first, state, effects, handlers, render
- Implement proper error handling with try-catch blocks
- Use consistent naming: camelCase for variables, PascalCase for components

**File Locations**: Based on project structure [Source: docs/architecture/source-tree.md]
- API Routes: `app/api/v1/admin/users/:id/roles/route.ts` and related endpoints
